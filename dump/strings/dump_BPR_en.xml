    <string id="1627745">{01} received a TOWN MAP\nfrom DAISY.</string>
    <string id="1627780">You don't have space for this in\nyour BAG.</string>

    <string id="1628003">It's a big map of the KANTO region.\nNow this would be useful!</string>

    <string id="1628277">You don't need any grooming done?\nOkay, we'll just have tea.</string>
    <string id="1628338">Which one should I groom?</string>
    <string id="1628364">DAISY: Okay, I'll get it looking\nnice in no time.</string>
    <string id="1628414">{02} looks dreamily content...\n\nDAISY: There you go! All done.\nSee? Doesn't it look nice?\n\nGiggle...\nIt's such a cute POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1628539">Oh, sorry. I honestly can't\ngroom an EGG.</string>
    <string id="1628581">DAISY: Your POKéMON grow to love\nyou if you raise them with love.\n\nFor example, {01}, may I see\nyour first POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="1628694">It couldn't possibly love you\nany more than it does now.\n\nYour POKéMON is happy beyond\nwords.</string>

    <string id="1629064">{01}, I don't like the way it\nglares at you.\n\nCould you try being a little nicer\nto it?</string>
    <string id="1629149">...Um, it's not easy for me to say\nthis, but...\n\nIs there some reason why your\nPOKéMON would hate you so much?</string>

    <string id="1629896">{06}: All right, Gramps!\nLeave it all to me!</string>
    <string id="1629939">{01}, I hate to say it, but you\nwon't be necessary for this.\n\nI know! I'll borrow a TOWN MAP\nfrom my sis!\n\nI'll tell her not to lend you one,\n{01}! Hahaha!\n\nDon't bother coming around to\nmy place after this!</string>
    <string id="1630140">OAK: {06}?\nLet me think...\n\nOh, that's right, I told you to\ncome! Just wait!\n\nHere, {01}.\n\nThere are three POKéMON here.\n\nHaha!\n\nThe POKéMON are held inside\nthese POKé BALLS.\n\nWhen I was young, I was a serious\nPOKéMON TRAINER.\n\nBut now, in my old age, I have\nonly these three left.\n\nYou can have one.\nGo on, choose!</string>
    <string id="1630442">OAK: Be patient, {06}.\nYou can have one, too!</string>
    <string id="1630486">OAK: Now, {01}.\n\nInside those three POKé BALLS are\nPOKéMON.\n\nWhich one will you choose for\nyourself?</string>
    <string id="1630583">OAK: Hey!\nDon't go away yet!</string>
    <string id="1630612">Ah! CHARMANDER is your choice.\nYou should raise it patiently.\n\nSo, {01}, you're claiming the\nFIRE POKéMON CHARMANDER?</string>
    <string id="1630727">Hm! SQUIRTLE is your choice.\nIt's one worth raising.\n\nSo, {01}, you've decided on the\nWATER POKéMON SQUIRTLE?</string>
    <string id="1630834">I see! BULBASAUR is your choice.\nIt's very easy to raise.\n\nSo, {01}, you want to go with\nthe GRASS POKéMON BULBASAUR?</string>
    <string id="1630949">This POKéMON is really quite\nenergetic!</string>
    <string id="1630989">{01} received the {02}\nfrom PROF. OAK!</string>
    <string id="1631024">OAK: If a wild POKéMON appears,\nyour POKéMON can battle it.\n\nWith it at your side, you should be\nable to reach the next town.</string>
    <string id="1631149">OAK: {01}, raise your young\nPOKéMON by making it battle.\n\nIt has to battle for it to grow.</string>
    <string id="1631237">OAK: Oh, {01}!\nHow is my old POKéMON?\n\nWell, it seems to be growing more\nattached to you.\n\nYou must be talented as a POKéMON\nTRAINER.\n\nWhat's that?\nYou have something for me?</string>
    <string id="1631407">{01} delivered OAK'S PARCEL.</string>
    <string id="1631434">Ah! \nIt's the custom POKé BALL!\n\nI had it on order.\nThank you!</string>
    <string id="1631496">OAK: Oh, right!\nI have a request for you two.</string>
    <string id="1631542">On the desk there is my invention,\nthe POKéDEX!\n\nIt automatically records data on\nPOKéMON you've seen or caught.\n\nIt's a high-tech encyclopedia!</string>
    <string id="1631685">OAK: {01} and {06}.\nTake these with you.</string>
    <string id="1631722">{01} received the POKéDEX\nfrom PROF. OAK.</string>
    <string id="1631762">OAK: You can't get detailed data\non POKéMON by just seeing them.\n\nYou must catch them to obtain\ncomplete data.\n\nSo, here are some tools for\ncatching wild POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1631923">{01} received five POKé BALLS.</string>
    <string id="1631952">When a wild POKéMON appears,\nit's fair game.\n\nJust throw a POKé BALL at it and\ntry to catch it!\n\nThis won't always work, however.\n\nA healthy POKéMON can escape.\nYou have to be lucky!</string>
    <string id="1632132">To make a complete guide on all\nthe POKéMON in the world...\n\nThat was my dream!\n\nBut, I'm too old.\nI can't get the job done.\n\nSo, I want you two to fulfill my\ndream for me.\n\nGet moving, you two.\n\nThis is a great undertaking in\nPOKéMON history!</string>
    <string id="1632369">POKéMON around the world wait for\nyou, {01}!</string>
    <string id="1632412">Ah, {01}!\nHow is your POKéDEX shaping up?\n\n{06} has already caught some\nPOKéMON and added to the data.\n\nSo, {01}, let's have a look at\nyour POKéDEX.\n\n...What's the matter?\nYou've added no new data at all.\n\nI'll give you these, so do try a\nlittle harder.</string>
    <string id="1632654">OAK: Come see me sometime.\n\nAfter all, I want to know how your\nPOKéDEX is coming along.</string>
    <string id="1632741">It's like an encyclopedia, but the\npages are blank.</string>
    <string id="1632793">Those are POKé BALLS.\nThey contain POKéMON!</string>

    <string id="1633291">Hi, {01}. I bet you've become\ngood friends with your POKéMON.\n\nBy the way, did you know about\nDAISY?\n\nIf you show DAISY your POKéMON,\nshe can tell how much it likes you.\n\nOccasionally, she will even groom\na POKéMON for you.\n\nThis is a secret, so please don't\ntell anyone.</string>
    <string id="1633557">PROF. OAK is going to have his own\nradio show soon.\n\nThe program will be called PROF.\nOAK's POKéMON SEMINAR.</string>
    <string id="1633665">PROF. OAK may not look like much,\nbut he's the authority on POKéMON.\n\nMany POKéMON TRAINERS hold him in\nhigh regard.</string>
    <string id="1633781">Ah, now this is excellent!\n\n{01}, I have another important\nfavor to ask of you.\n\nI need you to listen closely.</string>
    <string id="1633888">Recently, there have been sightings\nof many rare POKéMON species.\n\nI'm talking about POKéMON that\nhave never been seen in KANTO.\n\nI would love to go see things for\nmyself, but I'm much too old.\n\nSince I can't do it, {01}, I'd\nlike you to go in my place.</string>
    <string id="1634137">{06}: Hey, I heard that!\n\nGramps, what's with favoring\n{01} over me all the time?\n\nI went and collected more POKéMON,\nand faster, too.\n\nYou should just let me handle\neverything.</string>
    <string id="1634308">OAK: I know, I know.\nOf course I need your help, too.\n\nNow, I need to see both your\nPOKéDEXES.</string>
    <string id="1634402">PROF. OAK took both POKéDEX\nunits.</string>
    <string id="1634437">... ... ...  ... ... ...\n\n... ... ...  ... ... ...\n\n...And that's done!\n\nNow these units can record data on\na lot more POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1634536">{01}'s POKéDEX was upgraded!</string>
    <string id="1634563">Now, {01} and {06}!\n\nThis time, you really must work\ntowards filling your POKéDEXES.\n\nI urge you to make them the best\nand the most complete of all time!\n\nTruly, this is a monumentally great\nundertaking in POKéMON history!</string>
    <string id="1634779">{06}: Gramps, calm down.\nDon't get so excited.\n\nI'll get the POKéDEX completed,\ndon't you worry about a thing.\n\nI think I'll try looking around\nONE ISLAND first...\n\nAnyways, I'm outta here!</string>
    <string id="1634962">Coming up with nicknames is fun,\nbut it's not so easy to do.\n\nClever names are nice, but simple\nnames are easier to remember.</string>

    <string id="1637419">Okay!\n\nBe sure to read what's on the\nblackboard carefully!</string>
    <string id="1637477">Let's check out the notebook.\n\nFirst page...\n\nPOKé BALLS are used to catch\nPOKéMON.\n\nUp to six POKéMON can be carried\nin your party.\n\nPeople who raise and battle\nwith POKéMON are called TRAINERS.</string>
    <string id="1637667">Second page...\n\nA healthy POKéMON may be hard to\ncatch, so weaken it first.\n\nPoison, burn, or cause another\nstatus problem to weaken it.</string>
    <string id="1637800">Third page...\n\nPOKéMON TRAINERS seek others to\nengage in POKéMON battles.\n\nTo TRAINERS, the taste of victory\nis sweet, indeed.\n\nBattles are constantly waged at\nPOKéMON GYMS everywhere.</string>
    <string id="1637980">Fourth page...\n\nThe ultimate goal for all POKéMON\nTRAINERS is simple.\n\nIt is to defeat the top eight\nPOKéMON GYM LEADERS.\n\nDo so to earn the right to face...\n\nThe ELITE FOUR of the POKéMON\nLEAGUE!</string>

    <string id="1638219">The blackboard lists POKéMON\nSTATUS problems during battles.</string>
    <string id="1638280">Which topic do you want to read?</string>
    <string id="1638313">A POKéMON can't attack if it's\nasleep.\n\nPOKéMON will stay asleep even\nafter battles.\n\nUse AWAKENING to awaken one\nfrom sleep.</string>
    <string id="1638437">A burn reduces ATTACK power.\nIt also causes ongoing HP loss.\n\nA burn remains after a battle.\nUse BURN HEAL to cure a burn.</string>
    <string id="1638559">When poisoned, a POKéMON's health\nsteadily drops.\n\nPoison lingers after battles.\nUse an ANTIDOTE to cure poison!</string>
    <string id="1638671">A frozen POKéMON becomes\nhelplessly immobile.\n\nIt stays frozen even after the\nbattle ends.\n\nUse ICE HEAL to thaw out the\nsuffering POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1638809">Paralysis reduces SPEED and may\nprevent the POKéMON from moving.\n\nParalysis remains after battles.\nUse PARLYZ HEAL for treatment.</string>
    <string id="1638938">Hey!\nYou came from PALLET TOWN?</string>
    <string id="1638970">You know PROF. OAK, right?\n\nHis order came in.\nCan I get you to take it to him?</string>
    <string id="1639049">{01} received OAK'S PARCEL\nfrom the POKéMON MART clerk.</string>

    <string id="1639300">Please feel free to use that PC in\nthe corner.\n\nThe receptionist told me so.\nIt's so kind of her!</string>
    <string id="1639397">There's a POKéMON CENTER in every\ntown ahead.\n\nThey charge no money, so don't\nbe shy about healing POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="1639504">POKéMON CENTERS heal your tired,\nhurt, or fainted POKéMON.\n\nThey make all POKéMON completely\nhealthy.</string>
    <string id="1639605">Yes, yes.\nIt's $50 for a child's ticket.\n\nWould you like to come in?</string>

    <string id="1639857">AMBER contains the genetic matter\nof ancient POKéMON.\n\nThere's a LAB somewhere trying to\nresurrect POKéMON from AMBER.</string>
    <string id="1639975">AMBER is actually sap, that gooey\nstuff that oozes from trees.\n\nThe ancient sap fossilized over\ntime to become rock-hard AMBER.</string>

    <string id="1670883">The SAFARI ZONE actually has\nfour zones in it.\n\nEach zone has different kinds of\nPOKéMON, even some rare ones.\n\nUse the supplied SAFARI BALLS to\ncatch them.\n\nYou can also throw BAIT or ROCKS\nbesides the SAFARI BALLS.\n\nIf you throw BAIT, the POKéMON\nbecomes less likely to flee, but\n\nharder to catch.\n\nIf you throw ROCKS, the POKéMON\nbecomes more likely to flee, but\n\neasier to catch.\n\nWhen you run out of time or SAFARI\nBALLS, it's game over for you!</string>
    <string id="1671326">Sorry, you're a regular here!</string>

    <string id="1672745">Strength isn't the key for POKéMON.\nDo you understand this?\n\nPOKéMON is about strategy!\n\nI'll show you how strategy can\nbeat brute strength.</string>
    <string id="1672884">What?\nExtraordinary!</string>
    <string id="1672905">So, you mix brawn with brains?\nGood strategy!\n\nThat's remarkable for a child\nTRAINER.</string>

    <string id="1719060">The SEVII ISLANDS are in a warm\nregion overall.\n\nBut there is one exception you\nneed to know about.\n\nThe ICEFALL CAVE is frigid because\nof the POKéMON that live in it.</string>

    <string id="1719646">That MEADOW has belonged to our\nfamily for generations.\n\nI should have had a giant mansion\nbuilt on it.\n\nIt would be preferable to having\nthose thugs run wild on it!</string>

    <string id="1719943">You know of POKéMON that evolve\nonly upon trading, yes?\n\nBut did you know that there are\nstill others?\n\nSome POKéMON evolve only when\ntraded while holding specific items.</string>
    <string id="1720112">{06}: Hey, {01}!\nHow's your POKéDEX filling up?\n\nIt looks like it's impossible to get\nall the POKéMON by hanging around\n\njust these parts.\n\nMaybe there are POKéMON we don't\nknow about somewhere far away...\n\n... ... ...  ... ... ...  ... ... ...\n\nWell, if I can't do it, there's no\nway for you to get it done.\n\nI'm not going to get all desperate\nover this.\n\nI'll keep collecting POKéMON at my\nown pace while I train them.\n\nThat's what I'll do.\nSo there's no point staying here.\n\nI may as well leave for home.\n\nThat's that, then!\nSmell ya later!</string>
    <string id="1720622">There's nothing that young people'd\nfind exciting here on this island.\n\nBut, this is a good place in terms\nof nature and history.\n\nRelax and enjoy your stay.</string>

    <string id="1846858">You always get to ride your\nPOKéMON...\n\nIt looks so relaxing.\nCan I have it if I win?</string>
    <string id="1846941">Swimming's great!\nSunburns aren't!</string>
    <string id="1846976">These waters are treacherous!\nYou shouldn't come back here!</string>
