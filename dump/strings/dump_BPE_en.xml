    <string id="270539732">If it doesn't like a certain move,\na POKéMON will be reluctant to use it.\n\nIt doesn't matter how strong it is,\neither.\n\nFor example, a POKéMON with a GENTLE\nnature probably won't enjoy hurting\n\nits opponents.\n\nIf it can't seem to live up to its\npotential, it's probably failing at\n\nusing a disliked move against its will.</string>

    <string id="270550093">I wonder how our WALLY is doing?</string>
    <string id="270550126">{01}{05}! Please excuse us for\ndragging you here this way.\n\nBut our WALLY's become very healthy\nsince he went to VERDANTURF TOWN.\n\nWe owe it all to you!\n\nWhen WALLY left town, you helped\nhim catch a POKéMON, right?\n\nI think that made WALLY really\nhappy.\n\nActually, not just WALLY.\nIt made me, his father, happy too.\n\nHappy that he's gained such a great\nfriend as you.\n\nThis isn't a bribe or anything, but\nI'd really like you to have this.</string>
    <string id="270550554">If your POKéMON can SURF, you'll be\nable to go to all sorts of places.</string>
    <string id="270550625">WALLY's coming home soon.\nI'm looking forward to that.</string>
    <string id="270550680">Oh? You met WALLY in\nEVER GRANDE CITY?\n\nOh, {01}{05}, don't be silly.\n\nHe may have gotten healthy, but he\ncan't go somewhere far away like\n\nthat all by himself.</string>
    <string id="270550834">WALLY was really happy when he told\nus that he caught a POKéMON.\n\nIt's been ages since I've seen him\nsmile like that.</string>
    <string id="270550951">I want you to keep this a secret\nfrom my husband...\n\nBut our WALLY left VERDANTURF TOWN\nwithout telling anyone.\n\nYou know, WALLY is frail, but\nhe's surprisingly strong-willed.\n\nI'm sure that he'll come back safe\nand sound one day!</string>
    <string id="270555042">DAD: Hm?\n\nWell, if it isn't {01}!\nSo you're all finished moving in?\n\nI'm surprised that you managed to\nget here by yourself.\n\nOh, I see.\nYou're with your POKéMON.\n\nHm... Then I guess you're going to\nbecome a TRAINER like me, {01}.\n\nThat's great news!\nI'll be looking forward to it!</string>

    <string id="270555408">WALLY: I'm going to go stay with my\nrelatives in VERDANTURF TOWN.\n\nI thought I would be lonely by myself,\nso I wanted to take a POKéMON along.\n\nBut I've never caught a POKéMON before.\nI don't know how...</string>
    <string id="270555608">DAD: Hm. I see.</string>
    <string id="270555624">DAD: {01}, you heard that,\nright?\n\nGo with WALLY and make sure that he\nsafely catches a POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270555718">WALLY, here, I'll loan you my POKéMON.\n\nWALLY received a ZIGZAGOON!</string>
    <string id="270555785">WALLY: Oh, wow!\nA POKéMON!\n\nDAD: Hm. I'll give you a POKé BALL, too.\nGo for it!\n\nWALLY received a POKé BALL!</string>
    <string id="270555892">WALLY: Oh, wow!\nThank you!</string>
    <string id="270555919">{01}... Would you really come\nwith me?</string>
    <string id="270555954">DAD: So, did it work out?</string>
    <string id="270555980">WALLY: Thank you, yes, it did.\nHere's your POKéMON back.\n\n{01}, thank you for coming along\nwith me.\n\nYou two are why I was able to catch\nmy POKéMON.\n\nI promise I'll take really good\ncare of it.\n\nOh! My mom's waiting for me,\nso I have to go!\n\nBye, {01}!</string>
    <string id="270556224">DAD: Now...\n\n{01}, if you want to become a\nstrong TRAINER, here's my advice.\n\nHead for RUSTBORO CITY beyond this\ntown.\n\nThere, you should challenge\nthe GYM LEADER, ROXANNE.\n\nAfter her, go on to other POKéMON\nGYMS and defeat their LEADERS.\n\nCollect BADGES from them,\nunderstood?\n\nOf course, I'm a GYM LEADER, too.\nWe'll battle one day, {01}.\n\nBut that's only after you become\nstronger.</string>
    <string id="270556596">DAD: Hm? Aren't you going to the\nPOKéMON GYM in RUSTBORO CITY?\n\nThere's no challenge for me to\nbattle a greenhorn TRAINER.\n\n{01}, I want you to challenge me\nwhen you become a lot stronger.\n\nI'll battle you, {01}, when you\ncan show me four GYM BADGES, okay?</string>
    <string id="270556846">DAD: I see... So, you've beaten\nthe GYM LEADER in RUSTBORO CITY.\n\nBut there are many more TRAINERS\nwho are stronger than you, {01}.\n\nAcross the sea in DEWFORD TOWN is a\nGYM LEADER named BRAWLY.\n\nYou should go challenge him.</string>
    <string id="270557063">DAD: Hm... {01}, you have gotten\nstronger.\n\nI can tell by the number of BADGES\nthat you've earned.</string>
    <string id="270557157">DAD: Hm...\nSo, you did get four GYM BADGES.\n\nFine, as I promised, we will have\na POKéMON battle.\n\n{01}...\n\nI'm so happy that I can have\na real battle with my own child.\n\nBut, a battle is a battle!\n\nI will do everything in my power as\na GYM LEADER to win.\n\n{01}, you'd better give it your\nbest shot, too!</string>
    <string id="270557447">...\n\nI... I can't...\n\nI can't believe it. {01}...\n\nI lost to {01}?\n\nBut, rules are rules!\nHere, take this.</string>
    <string id="270557538">{01} received the BALANCE BADGE\nfrom DAD!</string>
    <string id="270557578">DAD: With that BADGE, the DEFENSE\nof all your POKéMON will increase.\n\nPOKéMON that know the HM move SURF\nwill be able to travel over water.\n\nThis is my gift to you. {01}, I'm\nsure you can use it correctly.</string>
    <string id="270557780">DAD: TM42 contains FACADE.\n\nIt doubles the power of moves if\nthe POKéMON is poisoned, paralyzed,\n\nor burned.\n\nIt might be able to turn a bad\nsituation into an advantage.</string>
    <string id="270557947">DAD: As the GYM LEADER, I can't\nexpress how upset I am...\n\nBut as a father, it makes me both\nhappy and a little sad. It's odd...</string>
    <string id="270558071">Ah, there you are, {01}{05}!\n\nPlease come with me.\nI have something I want you to have.</string>
    <string id="270558154">NORMAN, you don't mind, do you?\n\nLet me borrow your {01}{05} for\na minute or two.</string>
    <string id="270558231">DAD: {01}, you should go visit\nyour mother every so often.\n\nI'm going to stay here and redouble\nmy training.\n\nIt would bother me as a TRAINER to\nnot avenge my loss to you, {01}!</string>
    <string id="270558403">DAD: {01}, how are things going?\n\nThe world of POKéMON is deep.\n\nI honestly think that no amount of\ntraining would ever be enough.</string>
    <string id="270558530">Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound {01}?\n\nThe doors in this GYM open when you\nbeat the awaiting TRAINERS.\n\nWhoops! The doors in this room are\nalready open, so don't attack me!\n\nThe TRAINERS of PETALBURG GYM\nuse all kinds of items.\n\nThe door at the left leads to\nthe SPEED ROOM.\n\nThe door at the right leads to\nthe ACCURACY ROOM.\n\nThe room's name will be on\nthe door, so choose carefully.\n\nOnce you've chosen the door...\nWell, hey, go for it!</string>
    <string id="270558963">{01}! Whoa! You've overcome even\nyour own father!\n\nLike, whoa!\nWhat a stunning turn of events!</string>
    <string id="270559055">The ability to attack before the\nopponent...\n\nJust that alone puts me at a great\nadvantage, don't you agree?</string>
    <string id="270559161">That was a magnificent battle!</string>
    <string id="270559192">Go on to the next room where a new\nchallenge awaits you.\n\nAt the left is the CONFUSION ROOM.\n\nThe right door leads to the DEFENSE\nROOM.</string>
    <string id="270559326">Whomever you beat, and whomever you\nmay lose to, you never shirk from\n\ntraining yourself and your POKéMON.\n\nThat's what I think being a\nGYM LEADER is all about.</string>
    <string id="270559485">This is the CONFUSION ROOM.\n\nLet me see how well bonded you are\nwith your POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="270559567">I couldn't confuse your team enough...\nYou share a strong bond together.</string>
    <string id="270559638">The next room is the STRENGTH ROOM.\nCan you withstand brute force?</string>
    <string id="270559705">After you beat our LEADER, the\ntraining has become a lot tougher.</string>
    <string id="270559771">Just when you think you're going to\nwin, your opponent restores HP...\n\nCan you just imagine how awful that\nmust feel?\n\nI'll show you exactly how awful it\nfeels!</string>
    <string id="270559928">I couldn't restore HP enough...\nWhat ATTACK power...</string>
    <string id="270559977">I should have expected no less from\nour LEADER's kid.\n\nNo, wait! A TRAINER's abilities are\nearned only through effort.\n\nI lost because my own efforts\nweren't enough.\n\nGo on! The ONE-HIT KO ROOM is next.</string>
    <string id="270560177">I'm going to keep training at GYMS.\nOne day, I'll become a LEADER.</string>
    <string id="270560244">I'm not going to take it easy just\nbecause you're our LEADER's kid.\n\nI'll show you how horrid it is for\na POKéMON to take a critical hit!</string>
    <string id="270560381">Your power...\nYou're the real deal.</string>
    <string id="270560415">Your father really is strong.\nHe's a TRAINER worth my respect.\n\nAnd, I sense the same glow coming\nfrom you as your father.\n\nI hope that you'll stage a terrific\nbattle with your father!</string>
    <string id="270560598">Since your dad became the LEADER,\nthe TRAINERS of PETALBURG CITY have\n\nbecome a lot tougher.</string>
    <string id="270560690">Giggle...\nThis is the ACCURACY ROOM.\n\nIt's pretty nasty when every attack\nlands without fail.</string>
    <string id="270560781">You were a cut above me...</string>
    <string id="270560806">There are some even stronger\nTRAINERS waiting for you.\n\nThe left is the DEFENSE ROOM, and\nthe right is the RECOVERY ROOM.\n\nYour POKéMON's ATTACK power will be\non trial either way.</string>
    <string id="270560984">Do you know what we're trying to\nachieve as TRAINERS?\n\nWe're striving to become soul mates\nwith our POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270561092">The higher the DEFENSE, the more\nreckless I can be in attack.</string>
    <string id="270561154">Our defenses weren't enough...</string>
    <string id="270561183">I think you've taught me a valuable\nlesson here.\n\nNow, go on! The left door goes to\nthe STRENGTH ROOM.\n\nThe right door opens to\nthe ONE-HIT KO ROOM.\n\nBoth of them have TRAINERS who are\nskilled at offense.</string>
    <string id="270561385">Hi! Have you tried using SURF?</string>
    <string id="270561416">Our GYM LEADER told us to go all out\nand beat you.\n\nEven if you happen to be the\nLEADER's kid!</string>
    <string id="270561510">But... I went all out!</string>
    <string id="270561531">The way you use your POKéMON...\nIt's like your father's style.\n\nGo on through! The GYM LEADER, your\nfather, is waiting!</string>

    <string id="270592423">WATTSON: Ah-ha! Here at last!\nI know what you want.\n\nYou want to battle my POKéMON!\n\nWahahahaha!\n\nI'll make sparks fly from you!\nDon't say I didn't warn you!</string>
    <string id="270592578">Oof...\nOur batteries ran dry...</string>
    <string id="270592606">WATTSON: We'll have to recharge our\nbatteries again.\n\nWhen we're fully charged up, we'll\ngladly accept your challenge.\n\nSo, come back again sometime,\nwon't you?</string>
    <string id="270592765">WATTSON: Ah-ha! Here at last!\nI know what you want.\n\nYou want to battle my POKéMON!\n\nWahahahaha!\n\nOops! Wait!\nYou've only one POKéMON with you!\n\nCome see me with two or more\nPOKéMON, all right?</string>
    <string id="270593570">Well, well, what have we here?\nA most energetic customer!\n\nMe? You may call me RYDEL.\nI'm the owner of this cycle shop.</string>
    <string id="270593689">RYDEL: Your RUNNING SHOES...\nThey're awfully filthy.\n\nDid you come from far away?</string>
    <string id="270593768">RYDEL: Is that right?\n\nThen, I guess you have no need for\nany of my BIKES.</string>
    <string id="270593842">RYDEL: Hm, hm... ... ... ... ...\n\nYou're saying that you came all this\nway from LITTLEROOT?\n\nMy goodness!\nThat's ridiculously far!\n\nIf you had one of my BIKES, you could\ngo anywhere easily while feeling the\n\ngentle caress of the wind!\n\nI'll tell you what!\nI'll give you a BIKE!\n\nOh, wait a second!\n\nI forgot to tell you that there are\ntwo kinds of BIKES!\n\nThey are the MACH BIKE and\nthe ACRO BIKE!\n\nThe MACH BIKE is for cyclists who want\nto feel the wind with their bodies!\n\nAnd an ACRO BIKE is for those who\nprefer technical rides!\n\nI'm a real sweetheart, so you can\nhave whichever one you like!\n\nWhich one will you choose?</string>
    <string id="270594445">{01} chose the MACH BIKE.</string>
    <string id="270594469">{01} chose the ACRO BIKE.</string>
    <string id="270594493">RYDEL: If you get the urge to switch\nBIKES, just come see me!</string>
    <string id="270594555">RYDEL: Oh? Were you thinking about\nswitching BIKES?</string>
    <string id="270594607">RYDEL: Okay, no problem!\nI'll switch BIKES for you!</string>
    <string id="270594659">{01} got the MACH BIKE exchanged\nfor an ACRO BIKE.</string>
    <string id="270594708">{01} got the ACRO BIKE exchanged\nfor a MACH BIKE.</string>
    <string id="270594756">RYDEL: Good, good!\nI'm happy that you like it!</string>
    <string id="270594803">Oh? What happened to that BIKE\nI gave you?\n\nOh, I get it, you stored it using your PC.\n\nWell, take it out of PC storage,\nand I'll be happy to exchange it!\n\nMay the wind always be at your back\non your adventure!</string>
    <string id="270595011">I'm learning about BIKES while\nI work here.\n\nIf you need advice on how to ride your\nBIKE, there're a couple handbooks in\n\nthe back.</string>
    <string id="270595141">It's a handbook on the MACH BIKE.\n\nWhich page do you want to read?</string>
    <string id="270595207">A BIKE moves in the direction that\nthe + Control Pad is pressed.\n\nIt will speed up once it gets rolling.\n\nTo stop, release the + Control Pad.\nThe BIKE will slow to a stop.\n\nWant to read a different page?</string>
    <string id="270595408">A MACH BIKE is speedy, but it can't\nstop very quickly.\n\nIt gets a little tricky to get around\na corner.\n\nRelease the + Control Pad a little\nbefore the corner and slow down.\n\nWant to read a different page?</string>
    <string id="270595610">There are small sandy slopes\nthroughout the HOENN region.\n\nThe loose, crumbly sand makes it\nimpossible to climb normally.\n\nBut if you have a MACH BIKE, you can\nzip up a sandy slope.\n\nWant to read a different page?</string>
    <string id="270595821">It's a handbook on the ACRO BIKE.\n\nWhich page do you want to read?</string>
    <string id="270595887">Press the B Button while riding,\nand the front wheel lifts up.\n\nYou can zip around with the front\nwheel up using the + Control Pad.\n\nThis technique is called a wheelie.\n\nWant to read a different page?</string>
    <string id="270596085">Keeping the B Button pressed,\nyour BIKE can hop on the spot.\n\nThis technique is called a bunny hop.\n\nYou can ride while hopping, too.\n\nWant to read a different page?</string>
    <string id="270596248">Press the B Button and the + Control\nPad at the same time to jump.\n\nPress the + Control Pad to the side\nto jump sideways.\n\nPress it backwards to make the BIKE\nchange directions while jumping.\n\nWant to read a different page?</string>
    <string id="270596527">Woohoo!\n\nI hear people call me the ROCK SMASH\nGUY, but I find that sort of degrading.\n\nI think I deserve a bit more respect,\nlike maybe the ROCK SMASH DUDE.\n\nWoohoo!\n\nAnyways, your POKéMON look pretty\nstrong.\n\nI like that!\nHere, take this HIDDEN MACHINE!</string>
    <string id="270596777">That HM contains ROCK SMASH.\n\nIf you come across large boulders\nthat block your path...\n\nWell, use that HM move and smash\nthem right out of your way!\n\nYes, sir! Smash rocks aside, I say!\nWoohoo!</string>
    <string id="270596967">Oh, yes, if you smash a rock, a POKéMON\ncould come flying out of hiding.\n\nWoohoo!</string>
    <string id="270599264">This is MAUVILLE GAME CORNER.</string>
    <string id="270599294">Okay, you wanted some COINS for\nthe games?\n\nBut you don't have a COIN CASE for\nstowing the COINS.</string>
    <string id="270599391">Were you looking for COINS?\n\nIt's $1000 for 50 COINS.\nWould you like some?</string>
    <string id="270599465">Thank you very much!\nHere are your COINS!</string>
    <string id="270599507">Um... You don't appear to have\nenough money...</string>
    <string id="270599550">Oh?\nYour COIN CASE is full.</string>
    <string id="270599578">Oh... You don't need COINS, then?\nGood luck on your adventure!</string>
    <string id="270599639">Welcome.\n\nYou can exchange your COINS for\nprizes here.</string>
    <string id="270599693">Which prize would you like?</string>
    <string id="270599721">So your choice is\nthe {02} {03}?</string>
    <string id="270599750">Thank you!\nWe'll send it to your PC at home.</string>
    <string id="270599795">You don't have enough COINS.</string>
    <string id="270599871">Oh, is that so? \nYou need to save some COINS before\n\ncoming back here.</string>
    <string id="270599941">So your choice is {02}?</string>
    <string id="270599963">Here you go!</string>
    <string id="270600016">I made a mistake and got two of\nthe same DOLLS.\n\nWould you like one of them?</string>
    <string id="270600092">Here you go!</string>
    <string id="270600105">Huh?\nYou want it, but not right now?</string>
    <string id="270600142">Oh, don't be so negative!\nYou can have this!</string>
    <string id="270600187">There's a prize I want, but I can't win\nthe jackpot.</string>
    <string id="270600240">Hey, kid, if you want to play here,\nyou need a COIN CASE.\n\nI think the young lady next door\nhad one. Go see her!</string>
    <string id="270600352">My luck can only last so long.\nThis is too much for me.\n\nHere, take some COINS!</string>
    <string id="270600431">MAUVILLE has something for\neveryone.\n\nFor me, it's the GAME CORNER.</string>
    <string id="270600498">The ROULETTE tables have different\nrates.\n\nCheck your COINS if you're going to\npick a table.</string>
    <string id="270600590">It's easy to lose track of time in here. \nI should get back to work.</string>
    <string id="270600659">COINS are needed to play here\nin the GAME CORNER.</string>
    <string id="270600709">This ROULETTE thing...\nIt's rather demanding.\n\nWin or lose, it's only by luck.</string>
    <string id="270600785">Up to three COINS can be used to play\nthe SLOTS.</string>
    <string id="270600834">It's very difficult to make it stop\nright on «7.»\n\nIf it stops on «7» during the REEL TIME\nbonus game, you'll receive extra COINS.</string>
    <string id="270600964">Here's some information for you\nabout the SLOTS.\n\nThe more lightning bolts you stock,\nthe more REEL TIME chances you get.\n\nIn a game with the maximum five\nREEL TIME chances...\n\nIt is possible to receive four regular\nbonuses, then a big bonus.\n\nThat would total 660 COINS, but it's\nvery difficult to get.</string>
    <string id="270601262">You can't play if you don't have\na COIN CASE.</string>
    <string id="270601454">If I had a BIKE, it'd be easy to cycle to\nSLATEPORT for some shopping.\n\nI'd be able to buy HARBOR MAIL at the\nPOKéMON MART in SLATEPORT...</string>
    <string id="270601590">Oh! You have HARBOR MAIL?\nWill you trade it for a COIN CASE?</string>
    <string id="270601651">Oh, I'm so happy!\nOkay, I'll trade you a COIN CASE!</string>
    <string id="270601703">That COIN CASE can be used\nat the GAME CORNER.</string>
    <string id="270601750">Oh, that's disappointing.\n\nA COIN CASE is needed for the\nGAME CORNER.</string>
    <string id="270601889">That man over there, he says weird\nthings!\n\nHe's funny in a weird way.\nI doubt I'll forget about him!</string>
    <string id="270601990">When I accessed the RECORD CORNER,\nthe data for what's hot in DEWFORD\n\ngot updated.\n\nNow that bit of data is the same\nas my friend's!</string>
    <string id="270602122">A RECORD CORNER opened upstairs in\nthe POKéMON CENTER.\n\nI don't know what it's about, but it\nsounds fun. I'll go check it out!</string>
    <string id="270602296">Did you know that you can link battle\nat the COLOSSEUM here?\n\nThey put up your record on the wall\nfor everyone to see.\n\nIt's embarrassing if you lose more\noften than you win...</string>
    <string id="270602542">There are items that temporarily\nelevate the stats of POKéMON.\n\nThe ones I know you use in battle\nare X ATTACK and X DEFEND...\n\nI do believe that there are others\nlike them.</string>
    <string id="270602712">Use a certain move, or use an item\ninstead...\n\nThe TRAINER's decisions determine how\nbattles turn out, I think.</string>
    <string id="270603035">Hello and welcome to the DEVON\nCORPORATION.\n\nWe're proud producers of items and\nmedicine that enhance your life.</string>
    <string id="270603147">One of our research staff stupidly\ngot robbed of an important parcel.</string>
    <string id="270603217">Hey, those RUNNING SHOES!\nThey're one of our products!\n\nIt makes me happy when I see someone\nusing something we made.</string>
    <string id="270603334">That stolen parcel...\n\nWell, sure it's important, but it's not\nanything that anyone can use.\n\nIn my estimation, that robber must not\nhave been very bright.</string>
    <string id="270603486">It sounds like they've recovered\nthe ripped-off DEVON GOODS.</string>
    <string id="270603547">I'm sorry, only authorized people\nare allowed to enter here.</string>
    <string id="270603608">It's beyond stupid.\nHow could we get robbed?</string>
    <string id="270603653">Hi, there!\nYou're always welcome here!</string>
    <string id="270603692">Samples of rocks and metal are\ndisplayed in the glass case.\n\nThere's a panel with some writing\non it...\n\n«DEVON CORPORATION got its start as\na producer of stones from quarries.\n\n«The company also produced iron from\nfilings in the sand.\n\n«From that humble start as a producer\nof raw materials, DEVON developed.\n\n«DEVON is now a manufacturer of a wide\nrange of industrial products.»</string>
    <string id="270604066">Prototypes and test products fill\nthe glass display case.\n\nThere's a panel with a description...\n\n«In addition to industrial products,\nDEVON now markets sundries and\n\npharmaceuticals for better lifestyles.\n\n«Recently, DEVON has begun marketing\ntools for POKéMON TRAINERS, including\n\nPOKé BALLS and POKéNAV systems.»</string>
    <string id="270605307">We're developing a device for talking\nwith POKéMON.\n\nBut we haven't had much success...</string>
    <string id="270605392">I'm developing new kinds of\nPOKé BALLS...\n\nBut I haven't made much headway...</string>
    <string id="270605465">We finally made new kinds of\nPOKé BALLS!\n\nThe REPEAT BALL makes it easier to\ncatch POKéMON you've caught before.\n\nThe TIMER BALL gets better at catching\nPOKéMON the longer a battle runs.\n\nBoth are proudly developed by\nthe DEVON CORPORATION.\n\nPlease give them a try!</string>
    <string id="270605727">I made the POKéNAV!\n\nAs an engineer, I feel blessed to have\nmade something so great!</string>
    <string id="270605811">Oh, wow!\nThat's a POKéNAV!\n\nIt came about as a result of our\nPRESIDENT's desire to learn about\n\nthe feelings of POKéMON.\n\nWould you like me to describe its\nfeatures in detail?\n\nNo, no. I think you'll find out just by\ntrying the POKéNAV out.</string>
    <string id="270606048">I'm trying to develop a device that\nvisually reproduces the dreams of\n\nPOKéMON...\n\nBut it's not going well.</string>
    <string id="270606152">I've been trying to develop a device\nthat resurrects POKéMON from fossils...\n\nAnd, it's working!</string>
    <string id="270606246">Wait! That thing you have there...\nIs that a POKéMON fossil?\n\nWould you like to bring that POKéMON\nback to life?\n\nI can with my newly developed\nFOSSIL REGENERATOR.</string>
    <string id="270606406">Oh, is that so?\n\nDEVON's technological expertise\nis outstanding, I tell you.</string>
    <string id="270606482">Oh, now that's a surprise!\nYou have not one, but two, fossils?\n\nUnfortunately, my machine can only\nregenerate one POKéMON at a time.\n\nWould you like to pick one of your\nfossils for regeneration?</string>
    <string id="270606675">Excellent!\nLet's do this right away.\n\n{01} handed the {02} to\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.</string>
    <string id="270606754">The FOSSIL REGENERATOR, which I made,\nis incredible.\n\nBut it has one drawback--it takes\na long time to work.\n\nSo, uh... How about you go for a stroll\nand look around for a while?</string>
    <string id="270606929">Thanks for waiting!\n\nYour fossilized POKéMON has been\nbrought back to life!\n\nThe fossil was an ancient POKéMON.\n{03}, it was!</string>
    <string id="270607051">{01} received {03} from\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.</string>
    <string id="270607160">I'm trying to develop a new feature\nfor the POKéNAV...\n\nBut it's not going well.</string>
    <string id="270607238">Well, now what shall I work on\ndeveloping next?\n\nOur company allows us to make our\ninspirations into reality.\n\nOne couldn't ask for a better\nenvironment as an engineer.</string>
    <string id="270607881">I'm MR. STONE, the PRESIDENT of\nthe DEVON CORPORATION.\n\nI'd just got word about you!\n\nYou saved our staff not just once,\nbut twice!\n\nI have a favor to ask of an amazing\nperson like you.\n\nI understand that you're delivering\na package to SLATEPORT's SHIPYARD.\n\nWell, on the way, could you stop off in\nDEWFORD TOWN?\n\nI was hoping that you'd deliver a\nLETTER to STEVEN in DEWFORD.</string>
    <string id="270608252">MR. STONE: Now, you should know that\nI am a great PRESIDENT.\n\nSo, I'd never be so cheap as to ask\na favor for nothing in return.\n\nThat's why I want you to have this!</string>
    <string id="270608416">{01} received a POKéNAV.</string>
    <string id="270608439">MR. STONE: That device...\n\nIt's a POKéMON NAVIGATOR, or POKéNAV\nfor short.\n\nIt's an indispensable tool for any\nTRAINER on an adventure.\n\nIt has a map of the HOENN region.\n\nYou can check the locations of\nDEWFORD and SLATEPORT easily!\n\nBy the way, I've heard that sinister\ncriminals--MAGMA and AQUA, I believe--\n\nhave been making trouble far and wide.\n\nI think it would be best if you rested\nup before you go on your way.</string>
    <string id="270608850">MR. STONE: Well, then, {01}{05},\ngo with caution and care!</string>
    <string id="270608905">MR. STONE: I'm counting on you!</string>
    <string id="270608937">MR. STONE: You delivered my LETTER?\nThank you kindly!\n\nThis is my way of thanking you.\nIt should help you, a TRAINER.</string>
    <string id="270609054">MR. STONE: A POKéMON holding that\nEXP. SHARE will be given some of the\n\nEXP Points from battle.\n\nIt will get EXP Points even if it didn't\nactually battle.\n\nI would say EXP. SHARE is quite useful\nfor raising weak POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270609272">MR. STONE: Since my youth, I've immersed\nmyself in work.\n\nConsequently, I'm not familiar with\ntrends and that sort of thing.\n\nBut do young people all want to be\nTRAINERS in the POKéMON LEAGUE?</string>
    <string id="270609463">This is the DEVON CORPORATION's\nthird floor.\n\nOur PRESIDENT's OFFICE is on\nthis floor.\n\nAnyway, I can't tell you how much I'm\ngrateful for what you've done.\n\nUm... By the way, that parcel\nyou got back for us...\n\nCould I get you to deliver that to\nthe SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT?\n\nIt would be awful if those robbers\ntried to take it again.\n\nUh... Hehehe, so, uh, could I count\non you to do that for me?\n\nOh, that's right.\nCould you wait here a second?</string>
    <string id="270609896">Our PRESIDENT would like to have\na word with you.\n\nPlease come with me.</string>
    <string id="270609967">Please, go ahead.</string>
    <string id="270609985">If you visit the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT,\nyou should go see CAPT. STERN.</string>
    <string id="270610056">DEVON's new products, the REPEAT BALL\nand TIMER BALL, have become hugely\n\npopular among TRAINERS.</string>
    <string id="270610153">It's a collection of rare rocks and\nstones assembled by the PRESIDENT.</string>
    <string id="270610589">Yo, how's it going?\n\nListen, my friend!\nWould you like to become the CHAMPION?\n\nI'm no TRAINER, not me, but I can\nsure give you winning advice.\n\nThat's settled, then! We'll aim for the\nPOKéMON CHAMPIONSHIP together!\n\nIt's your job as a TRAINER to collect\nGYM BADGES, am I right?\n\nBut GYM LEADERS aren't pushovers!\n\nAnd that's where I come in!\nI'm here to provide expert advice!\n\nROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, is a user\nof ROCK-type POKéMON.\n\nThe ROCK type is very durable, but\nit can't stand WATER-type and\n\nGRASS-type moves.\n\nCome see me afterwards, if you beat\nthe GYM LEADER.\n\nWell, go for it!</string>
    <string id="270611170">Whoa! What a breathtaking victory!\nMy cheering must've worked!\n\nGreat!\nCheck your TRAINER CARD.\n\nThe STONE BADGE you got should be\nproperly recorded on it.\n\nIn other words...\n\nYou've climbed the first step on\nthe stairs to the CHAMPIONSHIP!\n\nThat's got to feel awesome!</string>
    <string id="270611433">Don't take us GYM TRAINERS lightly!\nI'll show you why we're better!</string>
    <string id="270611501">You were too good for me...</string>
    <string id="270611527">You haven't seen anything of the ROCK\ntype's terrifying power!</string>
    <string id="270611590">If you can't beat me, you won't stand\na chance against ROXANNE!</string>
    <string id="270611654">Wow! You've got some potential!</string>
    <string id="270611686">ROXANNE is stronger than me by\nseveral times.\n\nYou'd better be on your guard!</string>
    <string id="270611763">We might be in the middle of town,\nbut so what?\n\nMy ROCK POKéMON need room to\nrampage!</string>
    <string id="270611849">Oh, man oh man!\nOur challenger is one feisty customer!</string>
    <string id="270611904">I have to hand it to our LEADER.\n\nIt took smarts and sense for her to\npick the ROCK type at her young age.</string>
    <string id="270612010">Hello, I am ROXANNE, the RUSTBORO\nPOKéMON GYM LEADER.\n\nI became a GYM LEADER so that I might\napply what I learned at the POKéMON\n\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL in battle.\n\nWould you kindly demonstrate how you\nbattle, and with which POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="270612235">So...\nI lost...\n\nIt seems that I still have much more\nto learn...\n\nI understand.\n\nThe POKéMON LEAGUE's rules state\nthat TRAINERS are to be given this\n\nif they defeat a GYM LEADER.\n\nPlease accept the official POKéMON\nLEAGUE STONE BADGE.</string>
    <string id="270612460">{01} received the STONE BADGE\nfrom ROXANNE.</string>
    <string id="270612502">The STONE BADGE heightens the ATTACK\npower of your POKéMON.\n\nIt also enables them to use the HM move\nCUT outside of battle.\n\nPlease take this with you, too.</string>
    <string id="270612657">That TECHNICAL MACHINE, TM39,\ncontains ROCK TOMB.\n\nIt not only inflicts damage by dropping\nrocks, it also lowers SPEED.\n\nIf you use a TM, it instantly teaches\nthe move to a POKéMON.\n\nRemember, a TM can be used only once,\nso think before you use it.</string>
    <string id="270612903">Since you are so strong, you should\nchallenge other GYM LEADERS.\n\nBy battling many TRAINERS, you should\nlearn many things.</string>

    <string id="270632436">Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV.\n\nOh, yes. A big group of guests arrived\na little while ago.\n\nThey booked in as GAME FREAK,\nso I guess they must make games.\n\nUh-oh, I'd better get working on\ntheir dinner!</string>
    <string id="270632820">I'm the GAME DESIGNER.\n\nOh, is that right?\nYou're working on a POKéDEX?\n\nIt's tough trying to complete it,\nbut don't give up.\n\nIf you do complete it, please come\nshow me.</string>

    <string id="270633259">I'm the GRAPHIC ARTIST! Aren't the\nPOKéMON of HOENN interesting?</string>
    <string id="270633324">The girl TUBERS, they're cute, hey?\nTo battle against a cute TUBER...\n\nWhoop, it's so awesome!\n\nAnd the TWINS! Aren't they cute?\nA 2-on-2 battle with TWINS...\n\nWhoop, it's unbearably fun!</string>

I was snoozing!\n\nI came to check out this POKéMON\nCONTEST thing.\n\nI have to admit, it does look quite\nentertaining, but...\n\nConsider me a purist--I prefer\nbattles and tough TRAINERS.\n\nBut that's just me.\n\n{01}{05}, I hope you'll enjoy everything\nlike the GYMS, CONTESTS, BATTLE TENT,\n\nthe whole works!</string>
    <string id="270634035">SCOTT: I think it does take strategy\nto win a CONTEST.\n\nDevising CONTEST strategies is one way\nof becoming a better TRAINER, I'd say.</string>
    <string id="270634571">Welcome to LILYCOVE MUSEUM.\n\nPlease take the time to enjoy our\ncollection of fantastic artwork\n\nfeaturing POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270634684">I'm the CURATOR of this MUSEUM of\nfine arts.\n\nIt's heartening to see someone so\nyoung as you in our MUSEUM.\n\nHave you viewed our collection of\npaintings already?</string>
    <string id="270634844">Ah, then let me not disturb you.\nPlease, do take your time.</string>
    <string id="270634904">Oh? I do believe that you seem to\nbe a POKéMON TRAINER.\n\nHave you an interest in paintings,\ntoo?</string>

    <string id="270635061">Ah, excellent!\nYou do like paintings!\n\nThen, may I ask you to come with me?</string>
    <string id="270635136">It's a very old painting.\nThe paint is peeling here and there.</string>
    <string id="270635199">It's an odd landscape with bizarre\nand fantastic scenery.</string>
    <string id="270635257">It's a painting of a beautiful, smiling\nwoman with a POKéMON on her lap.</string>
    <string id="270635330">It's a painting of a legendary POKéMON\nfrom long ago.\n\nThe artist painted this from\nimagination.</string>
    <string id="270635426">It's a painting of GRASS POKéMON\nswaying in a breeze.\n\nThey appear to be enjoying the wind's\ngentle caress.</string>
    <string id="270635533">It's a delicious-looking painting\nof BERRIES.\n\nThis painting could make you hungry!</string>
    <string id="270635616">It's a replica of a famous sculpture.\n\nIt depicts an ancient BIRD POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270635690">It's a big POKé BALL carved from\na black stone.\n\nIt was apparently used in festivals\nin the olden days.</string>
    <string id="270635793">It's a huge stone tablet inscribed\nwith POKéMON and dense text in the\n\nsmall characters of an ancient,\n\nunreadable language.</string>
    <string id="270635956">Battling with POKéMON is fun,\nI'll grant you that.\n\nBut one mustn't forget our love for\nthe fine arts.</string>
    <string id="270636058">This ART MUSEUM... Well, you could\nsee many fantastic paintings.\n\nAnd the CURATOR is a wonderful person.\n\nAmong artists like myself, this MUSEUM\nis an inspiration.</string>
    <string id="270636218">This lady is pretty!\nShe's like Mommy!</string>
    <string id="270636257">This POKéMON is adorable!\nJust like our little boy!</string>
    <string id="270636309">I'd heard that this ART MUSEUM got\nin some new paintings.\n\nSo, naturally I hurried over.\n\nAre the new paintings up on\nthe second floor?</string>
    <string id="270636443">Lately, the CURATOR has been\nunusually cheerful.\n\nI bet something good happened for him.\nDefinitely.</string>
    <string id="270636543">I aim to see many great paintings\nhere and learn from them.\n\nI have this dream of one day having\nmy artwork exhibited here.</string>
    <string id="270636666">The ART MUSEUM has become a favorite\ntourist destination.\n\nIt's great for LILYCOVE...\nNo, great for the HOENN region!\n\nThis is what I've heard--a lone TRAINER\nprocured all the paintings upstairs.</string>
    <string id="270637547">This is our special exhibit hall.</string>
    <string id="270637581">As you can plainly see, there is not\na single painting on exhibit.\n\nHere, I don't wish to exhibit works of\nso-called classical art.\n\nSuch classical works you can see on\nour ground floor.\n\nI wish to exhibit work that is far\ndifferent from the classics.\n\nArt, after all, is not restricted to old,\nfamous works!\n\nThis exhibit hall, I wish to fill it with...\n\nModern and vibrant artworks of\nPOKéMON seemingly ready to spring\n\nforth into glorious life!</string>
    <string id="270638020">I beg your pardon. I didn't intend\nto monopolize the conversation.\n\nNow, as you are young, and yet\nobviously well traveled...\n\nYou must encounter lively POKéMON\nand works of art depicting them.\n\nIf you were to come across such\na painting, may we ask you to obtain\n\nthe artist's permission to exhibit\n\nit here?</string>
    <string id="270638323">I wish to fill this exhibit hall with\nmodern and vibrant paintings of\n\nPOKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270638402">Thanks to you, we've added a new\npainting to our collection!\n\nI've heard it depicts your POKéMON.\nTruly magnificent!\n\nThank you so very, very much!</string>
    <string id="270638548">Ah! It's you!\n{01}!</string>
    <string id="270638566">Isn't this marvelous?\nThis collection of paintings!\n\nEach one of them flawless!\nNone better than another!\n\nThese paintings have attracted\nmore guests to our ART MUSEUM.\n\nSincerely, I thank you, {01}.\nThis is my dream come true!</string>

    <string id="270639008">It's a picture frame with pink-colored\nadornments.</string>
    <string id="270639059">It's a picture frame with\nyellow-colored adornments.</string>
    <string id="270639112">It's a picture frame with\nblue-colored adornments.</string>
    <string id="270639163">It's a picture frame with\nred-colored adornments.</string>
    <string id="270639213">It's a picture frame with\ngreen-colored adornments.</string>
    <string id="270639265">It's a painting of POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270639293">I've been away awhile, so the new\npaintings up here surprised me.\n\nI wish someone would paint my POKéMON\nthis pretty.</string>
    <string id="270639410">Well... So this is where they show\nthe topical POKéMON paintings.\n\nI see, these new paintings are indeed\nrather amusing.</string>
    <string id="270639528">Wow, is that right?\nThese paintings are of your POKéMON.\n\nIsn't that just the ultimate joy for\na TRAINER?</string>
    <string id="270642448">Yippee!\n\nThe lady at the reception counter\ngave me a case for POKéBLOCKS!</string>
    <string id="270642517">Make POKéBLOCKS and put them in there.\n\nWhen you make a POKéBLOCK, everyone\nhas to put in a different BERRY.</string>
    <string id="270642617">Congratulations!\n\nI did a painting of your POKéMON to\ncommemorate its victory...\n\nWell, your POKéMON's appeals were\nso fantastic, it spurred me into\n\npainting better than I usually do.\n\nLook, see?</string>
    <string id="270642808">What do you think? I'm confident in\nwhat I've done, but do you like it?\n\nA work of this caliber, it wouldn't look\nout of place in an art museum.\n\nHuh? An art museum really is looking\nfor paintings?\n\nDo you think I should take this there?</string>
    <string id="270643043">What, really? Then, sure, I will take\nthis painting there right now.\n\nI'll give it a proper title, too.\n\nI hope they'll like it and consider\nexhibiting this.\n\nPlease check if they did accept this.\nThank you!</string>
    <string id="270643248">Oh, that's right!\n\nAs a memento of me painting your\nPOKéMON, please take this.</string>
    <string id="270643326">{01} received a RIBBON.</string>
    <string id="270643348">{01} put the RIBBON on\n{02}.</string>
    <string id="270643373">Okay, see you!</string>
    <string id="270643388">Oh... Then, I guess I'll just take\nthis home with me...\n\nBut, you know, I would like to take\nthis to the art museum... Okay?</string>
    <string id="270643506">Oh, fine, that's the way it is.\nI will hang this in my own house.\n\nI'll just have to try harder next time.\nWell, be seeing you.</string>
    <string id="270643633">Hoo, boy... Master Rank CONTESTS,\nhere I come.\n\nThe world will know that my dearest\nPOKéMON is the cutest being in all\n\nexistence. The time has come!\n\nUheheheh.</string>
    <string id="270643789">You can see a whole variety of\nPOKéMON here.\n\nThat's why I make this place a regular\npart of my daily stroll.</string>
    <string id="270643898">Wow, coming out to a CONTEST is\na feast for these eyes!\n\nWould you look at all the POKéMON\nthat just scream to be painted?</string>
    <string id="270644020">The TOUGHNESS CONTEST is like\nextreme, man!\n\nThose muscular appeals...\nCascading sweat... I swoon!</string>
    <string id="270644114">Day in and day out, I lavished my care\non this POKéMON.\n\nIts condition is peaking.\nToday, victory is mine!</string>
    <string id="270644220">I made POKéBLOCKS with Mom, Dad, and\nBig Sister. They turned out great!\n\nI bet you can make smoother, better\nPOKéBLOCKS if you have more people.</string>
    <string id="270645070">This POKéMON won the BEAUTY CONTEST\nhere before.\n\nWell, guess what? Today, I made it\nwin a SMARTNESS CONTEST!\n\nMy abilities scare even me...</string>
    <string id="270645207">I've entered a bunch of CONTESTS,\nso I'm seeing how things work.\n\nIf you're in a COOLNESS CONTEST,\ncool moves go over as appeals.\n\nBut smart moves and cute moves\ndon't go over well, for instance.</string>
    <string id="270645401">That young man who won earlier had\na whole bunch of different POKéBLOCKS.\n\nCan you win if you had that many\nof those things?</string>
    <string id="270645521">Whoa, isn't this place humongous!\n\nThe tension in the air... It's not\nlike a CONTEST hall in the sticks.</string>
    <string id="270645623">MC: Okay, SMART POKéMON and their\nTRAINERS, are you ready?!\n\nGive it your best showing!\nLet's appeal!</string>
    <string id="270645724">JUDGE: Are you enjoying this CONTEST?\n\nCome back with three friends, and\nall of you may enter a CONTEST!</string>
    <string id="270645828">Ayayayay...\nI entered the wrong CONTEST.\n\nI entered this tough POKéMON in\nthe SMARTNESS CONTEST...\n\nCome on, wow them with a smart-looking\nROCK SMASH.</string>
    <string id="270645973">I've spent many a year, and all my\nwisdom besides, raising this POKéMON\n\nto be smart.\n\nIt won't be easily bested by some\nyoung pup's POKéMON.\n\nMy dear wife, are you seeing this?</string>
    <string id="270646148">There it is!\n\nIf my POKéMON pulls a smart move next,\nthe audience's excitement will peak!</string>
    <string id="270646237">Oh, dear, no!\n\nMy darling ZUBAT's LEECH LIFE is so\ncute I kept using it over and over!\n\nBut these mean people don't appreciate\nit at all!</string>
    <string id="270646373">Kiyaaah! You're beautiful, Grandpa!</string>
    <string id="270646409">Even when TRAINERS enter the same\nkind of POKéMON, they all seem to use\n\ndifferent moves for appeals.\n\nIt's just like the way people have\ndifferent styles for battling.</string>
    <string id="270646576">I think the POKéMON look smarter\nthan their TRAINERS. By a lot.</string>
    <string id="270646640">When all's said and done, I still love\nSMARTNESS CONTESTS.\n\nThat intellectual green color...\nIt's so... So... Cool.</string>
    <string id="270646749">MC: Are you entering the BEAUTY\nCONTEST, too? Good luck!</string>
    <string id="270646806">JUDGE: Ah, every POKéMON here is\na model of pristine beauty!\n\nWhy, I almost forgot to score them!</string>
    <string id="270646903">A POKéMON this beautiful...\nThere isn't another one like it.\n\nEveryone's eyes will be glued to\nmy beauty.</string>
    <string id="270647006">Waaaah!\n\nI brushed and groomed my POKéMON\ncarefully for this CONTEST...\n\nBut I overdid it...\nMy POKéMON's coat turned all scraggly...\n\nWhat should I do?</string>
    <string id="270647150">This AURORA BEAM is so dazzling,\nthe JUDGE won't be able to see it.\n\nUh, wait a second...\nThat'll be meaningless, then!</string>
    <string id="270647267">This pretty POKéMON looks just like\nme when I was younger.\n\nRight when I said that, my husband\nspewed the coffee he was drinking.\n\nDid I say something funny?</string>
    <string id="270647423">You know, if I win at a BEAUTY\nCONTEST, sure it makes me\n\nhappy. More than usual, anyway.</string>
    <string id="270647512">Wahahahah!\n\nWill you take a gander at all those\npretty POKéMON!\n\nI just love this sort of glitz!</string>
    <string id="270647607">You can't always win on just beauty\nalone.\n\nYou have to groom your POKéMON so\nit's nice and glossy like mine.</string>
    <string id="270647716">MC: Uh-oh! Hello!\nWe're in the middle of a CONTEST!\n\nPlease enter at our registration\ncounter and come out, okay?</string>
    <string id="270647829">JUDGE: Oh, such charming and cute\nappeals!\n\nOh, my goodness! What a perfectly\nadorable WATER SPORT appeal!</string>
    <string id="270647935">Oh, no... My sweet AZURILL was\ndistracted by another POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270647995">My POKéMON has never won in a battle,\nbut put it in a CONTEST and look out!</string>
    <string id="270648071">My POKéMON's PETAL DANCE is a marvel\nof elegance.\n\nI won't let anyone disturb its\nperformance.</string>
    <string id="270648165">Everyone's POKéMON are very cute.\n\nHowever, if my POKéMON were to make\na cute appeal...\n\nI'm sure that it would be so much \ncuter than the others.</string>
    <string id="270648308">My child is in this CONTEST.</string>
    <string id="270648337">Come on, dear. Go for it!\nYour POKéMON is the best!</string>
    <string id="270648389">I think that girl over there is\nthe cutest of the lot.\n\nWhat's that? They're judging\nPOKéMON by their looks?</string>
    <string id="270648497">Ohh, seeing all these cute POKéMON,\nthey make we want to get my own!\n\nI'm going to go catch some!</string>

    <string id="270648699">SMARTNESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE IMPRESSED BY SMART POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="270648862">I wonder how many kinds of POKéMON\nthere are in the world.\n\nIt'd be great to cross seas and\ntrade POKéMON with people far away.</string>
    <string id="270648989">I've been hearing about some rotten\nscoundrels who steal POKéMON and rip\n\noff METEORITES.</string>
    <string id="270649078">Those rotten scoundrels who steal\nPOKéMON and rip off METEORITES...\n\nI haven't seen them around recently.</string>
    <string id="270651136">Oh, wow!\nIt's {01}!</string>
    <string id="270651154">I've heard the news!\nYou're really strong, aren't you?\n\nWe always argue about who is the\nstrongest of all TRAINERS here.\n\nSo when I heard about you, I decided\nto be your fan!\n\nI hope you'll keep on battling other\ntough TRAINERS.\n\nThat way, we'll be able to see more\nof your hot, hot battles.\n\nThat will make the others here see\nexactly how great you are.\n\nRemember, I'm cheering for you,\n{01}!</string>

    <string id="270651690">I hate to say this, but the TRAINER\neverybody's talking about is\n\n{02}, no question about it!\n\nThat TRAINER's power...\nIt's out of the ordinary.</string>
    <string id="270651829">Darn it... I've been telling people\nthat {02} is the best now...\n\nBut no one wants to listen...</string>
    <string id="270651916">I've been hearing things about\na tough new TRAINER.\n\nThis TRAINER's supposed to be beating\nGYM LEADERS, even.\n\nDo you know anything about this\nnew TRAINER?</string>
    <string id="270652070">Oh!\n{01}!\n\nGo for it!\nI'm pulling for you!</string>
    <string id="270652110">Sigh...\nBRAWLY...\n\nOh, no! Wait!\nThat's not right! No, no, no!\n\nI'm your fan through and through!\n\nSo make me proud!\nGo for it!</string>

    <string id="270652472">You've surpassed your own father in\nevery regard!\n\nI'm telling you, so there's no question\nabout it at all!</string>
    <string id="270652579">Even when things turned bleak,\nyour father never gave up.\n\nThis I know to be true.\n\nYou never give up even if you lose!\nSo keep on battling!</string>
    <string id="270652718">NORMAN battled with more power,\ncharisma, and showmanship than you.\n\nEven though people may say that\nyou're strong...\n\nYou've still got a long way to go\ncompared to your father.</string>
    <string id="270652892">You're beginning to get the same\nair of awe NORMAN exudes.\n\nBut there's something conclusively\ndifferent between you and NORMAN.\n\nI can't tell you what that is.\nYou'll have to find it yourself.</string>
    <string id="270653084">Everyone here, we're all huge fans\nof POKéMON battles.\n\nWe discuss who we consider to be\nthe strongest of all TRAINERS.\n\nIf you were to become famous,\nwe might even become your fans!</string>

    <string id="270696610">Well, how do you like that? I lost!\nEh, it was fun, so it doesn't matter.</string>
    <string id="270696684">Well, listen to what this loser has\nto say.\n\nYou've got what it takes to go far.\nNow, go on to the next room and enjoy\n\nyour next battle!</string>
    <string id="270696974">Ahahaha!\n\nI'm PHOEBE of the ELITE FOUR.\nI did my training on MT. PYRE.\n\nWhile I trained, I gained the ability\nto commune with GHOST-type POKéMON.\n\nYes, the bond I developed with POKéMON\nis extremely tight.\n\nSo, come on, just try and see if you can\neven inflict damage on my POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="270697253">Oh, darn.\nI've gone and lost.</string>
    <string id="270697283">There's a definite bond between you\nand your POKéMON, too.\n\nI didn't recognize it, so it's only\nnatural that I lost.\n\nYup, I'd like to see how far your bond\nwill carry you.\n\nGo ahead, move on to the next room.</string>
    <string id="270697644">Welcome, my name is GLACIA\nof the ELITE FOUR.\n\nI've traveled from afar to HOENN\nso that I may hone my ice skills.\n\nBut all I have seen are challenges by\nweak TRAINERS and their POKéMON.\n\nWhat about you?\n\nIt would please me to no end if I could\ngo all out against you!</string>

    <string id="270698302">I am the last of the POKéMON LEAGUE\nELITE FOUR, DRAKE the DRAGON master!\n\nIn their natural state, POKéMON are\nwild living things. They are free.\n\nAt times, they hinder us.\nAt times, they help us.\n\nFor us to battle with POKéMON as\npartners, do you know what it takes?\n\nDo you know what is needed?\n\nIf you don't, then you will never\nprevail over me!</string>
    <string id="270698645">Superb, it should be said.</string>
    <string id="270698672">You deserve every credit for coming\nthis far as a TRAINER of POKéMON.\n\nYou do seem to know what is needed.\n\nYes, what a TRAINER needs is a\nvirtuous heart.\n\nPOKéMON touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and learn good from wrong.\n\nThey touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and grow strong.\n\nGo! Go onwards!\nThe CHAMPION is waiting!</string>
    <string id="270699596">WALLACE: Welcome, {01}{05}.\n\nThat incident in SOOTOPOLIS CITY...\nThat was superb work, putting an end\n\nto that crisis all by yourself.\n\nOops!\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to say that you\nalone ended the crisis.\n\nYou overcame that difficult situation\nby working as one with your POKéMON.\n\nWe TRAINERS raise POKéMON by giving\nthem items and by teaching them new\n\ntechniques for battle.\n\nBut we ourselves also learn many\nthings from POKéMON.\n\nAnd this is where your achievements\nare put to the test against what\n\nothers like you have achieved.\n\nNow!\n\nWho can most elegantly dance with\ntheir POKéMON in HOENN?\n\nShow me right here and now!</string>
    <string id="270700204">I, the CHAMPION, fall in defeat...\n\nThat was wonderful work.\nYou were elegant, infuriatingly so.\n\nAnd yet it was utterly glorious!\n\nKudos to you, {01}{05}!\n\nYou are a truly noble POKéMON\nTRAINER!</string>
    <string id="270700390">WALLACE: The POKéMON you sent into\nbattle...\n\nAt times they danced like a spring\nbreeze, and at times they struck\n\nlike lightning.\n\nIt was with light, yet surefooted,\nelegance that you led your POKéMON.\n\nEven I felt bedazzled by your\nmasterful performance!\n\nYou now stand at the glorious peak\nof the POKéMON LEAGUE.\n\nI now proclaim you to be the new\nHOENN region...</string>

    <string id="270754756">Okay!\nWell done!</string>
    <string id="270754773">Getting through here safely--that's\nthe final test for any TRAINER aiming\n\nto become the POKéMON CHAMPION.\n\nThat's why it's called the VICTORY\nROAD.</string>
    <string id="270754920">I have nothing to say to anyone\nthat's come this far. Come on!</string>
    <string id="270754983">This is a disgrace...</string>
    <string id="270755003">Humph, go right on ahead.\nSee if I care.</string>
    <string id="270755160">The thought that I'm getting closer to\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE...\n\nI'm getting stage fright...</string>
    <string id="270755245">I couldn't do a thing...</string>
    <string id="270755268">The POKéMON LEAGUE became distant\nagain... What a letdown...</string>
    <string id="270755325">To win your way through the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you need the trust of your\n\nPOKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270755405">Your relationship is based on\nsolid trust.</string>
    <string id="270755448">By being together all the time, trust\ngrows between POKéMON and TRAINERS.</string>
    <string id="270755522">This isn't the goal. It's only a place\non the way to the POKéMON LEAGUE.</string>
    <string id="270755595">That's the way!</string>
    <string id="270755611">You'll do fine, for sure!\nYour POKéMON are all eager to go!</string>
    <string id="270755671">My POKéMON are cosmically\nawe inspiring!</string>
    <string id="270755712">I've never met anyone like you before.</string>
    <string id="270755751">Even outside of battle, I sense\nincredible power emanating from you\n\nand your POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="270755837">Okay, no need to get your back up!\nRelax, let's take it easy!</string>
    <string id="270755899">Whoa!\nWonderful!</string>
    <string id="270755916">Sure, this is VICTORY ROAD.\n\nBut it's not all that different from\nthe path you've taken so far.\n\nTry to enjoy things the rest of\nthe way!</string>
    <string id="270756191">I trained together with my whole family,\nevery one of us!\n\nI'm not losing to anyone!</string>
    <string id="270756275">Better than my family?!\nIs that possible?!</string>
    <string id="270756318">I was better than everyone in my\nfamily. I've never lost before...\n\nI've lost my confidence...\nMaybe I'll go home...</string>
    <string id="270756428">I'd heard that there was a tough\nlittle kid around. Do they mean you?</string>
    <string id="270756498">The little shrimp is tough!</string>
    <string id="270756526">The rumors I heard, that tough little\nkid is from PETALBURG CITY.</string>
    <string id="270756592">You must be getting a little tired.</string>
    <string id="270756628">No signs of tiring at all!</string>

    <string id="270756874">You're better than me!</string>
    <string id="270756897">Gaze on your collected BADGES and\nremember the TRAINERS you've faced.</string>
    <string id="270756967">I've come this far, but the tension's\ngiving me awful stomach pain...</string>
    <string id="270757035">Ooh...\nIt hurts...</string>
    <string id="270757050">I can't help getting all tense knowing\nthat I'm nearing the POKéMON LEAGUE.\n\nIt's all I can do to feign calm.</string>

    <string id="270757230">Not rattled in the least bit!</string>
    <string id="270757260">You do have guts! I like that!\nKeep it going!</string>
    <string id="270758379">The penetrating cold around these\nparts is an impediment to training.\n\nBut with focus, one can overcome!\n\nWith this FOCUS BAND, buckle down and\nwithstand the cold!</string>

    <string id="270760389">What's so funny about having my inner\ntube aboard the ship?</string>
    <string id="270760449">Whoa, you overwhelmed me!</string>
    <string id="270760475">It's not easy throwing POKé BALLS\nwhile hanging on to an inner tube!</string>
    <string id="270760544">Isn't it fun here?\nI get excited just being here!</string>
    <string id="270760725">Ships of this sort are rare, so I'm\ntaking a look around.\n\nHmhm...\nThere appear to be other cabins...</string>
    <string id="270760822">What on earth would compel you to\ncome here? You must be curious!</string>
    <string id="270760888">Not just curious, but also strong...</string>
    <string id="270760923">The man next door...\n\nHe says he's just sightseeing,\nbut I don't know about that.</string>

    <string id="270761138">Aren't you too strong?</string>
    <string id="270761161">I'm sure that man's up to something!\nHe just acts so suspiciously!</string>
    <string id="270761228">Waaah!\nI've been found! ...Huh?</string>
    <string id="270761258">Oh, you're not my mom.</string>
    <string id="270761281">I'm in trouble with my mom, so I ran.\nKeep it a secret where I am!</string>
    <string id="270761514">When we go out to sea, we SAILORS\nalways bring our POKéMON.\n\nHow about a quick battle?</string>
    <string id="270761600">Whoops, I'm sunk!</string>
    <string id="270761618">The ship's bottom has sunk into the\ndepths.\n\nIf a POKéMON knew how to go underwater,\nwe might make some progress...</string>

    <string id="270787600">Those people squabbling over there...\n\nIt's hard to believe, but they once\nwere TRAINERS, and good ones, too.\n\nThey used to be incredibly tough,\nand they were famous, too.\n\nBut they were obliterated by this\ncertain TRAINER at a tournament.\n\nThey were so thoroughly whipped,\nthey became smitten by the TRAINER.\n\nNow they're just fans of the TRAINER.\nThey go cheer for their idol at the\n\nBATTLE DOME every day now.</string>
    <string id="270788005">I heard a rumor that someone saw\na POKéMON with an unusually long tail\n\nsomewhere in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\n\nIt must be adorable. I'm sure of it...\n\nOh, challenges can wait. I feel driven\nto find the delightful creature!</string>

    <string id="270853686">Sigh...\n\nYou failed to save before you ended\nyour challenge the last time.\n\nAs a result, your challenge has been\ndisqualified. It is most unfortunate.</string>
    <string id="270853859">For a hardy fellow like me,\nhardy POKéMON are the best.\n\nOffense is the best defense!\nA relentless attack is the ultimate!\n\nBut that's not what I wanted to chat\nabout.\n\nEvery so often a really cute lady\nswings by here.\n\nShe says that she can tell what\nPOKéMON are thinking.\n\nI don't know about that part,\nbut she is really cute.\n\nHuh?\nWhy are you looking at me like that?</string>
    <string id="270854225">Hmm...\n\nIt appears that the nature of POKéMON\nand the moves that they have been\n\ntaught are the keys to battle here.\n\nTo be more precise, it's how well\nthe moves match the nature of\n\nthe POKéMON.\n\nIf your POKéMON is in trouble and\nunable to live up to its potential,\n\nyou may need to examine how well\n\nits moves match its nature.</string>
    <string id="270854546">My POKéMON is usually very docile.\n\nBut when it's in a BATTLE HALL,\nit sometimes seems to become\n\ntransformed into something wicked!\n\nIt becomes totally intimidating.\nIt's shocking, even.</string>
    <string id="270854731">I wonder what sort of nature a POKéMON\nwould have if it favored enfeebling its\n\nopponents and chipping away slowly.\n\nI'd be surprised if it was a LAX nature.\n\nBut, nah, that can't be right.</string>

    <string id="270856072">Which heading do you want to read?</string>
    <string id="270856107">Here, POKéMON are required to think\nand battle by themselves.\n\nUnlike in the wild, POKéMON that live\nwith people behave differently\n\ndepending on their nature.</string>
    <string id="270856265">Depending on its nature, a POKéMON\nmay prefer to attack no matter what.\n\nAnother POKéMON may prefer to protect\nitself from any harm.\n\nYet another may enjoy vexing or\nconfounding its foes.\n\nDue to its nature, a POKéMON\nwill have favorite moves that it is good\n\nat using.\n\nIt may also dislike certain moves that\nit has trouble using.</string>
    <string id="270856592">There are offensive moves that inflict\ndirect damage on the foe.\n\nThere are defensive moves that are\nused to prepare for enemy attacks or\n\nused to heal HP and so on.\n\nThere are also other somewhat-odd\nmoves that may enfeeble the foes with\n\nstat problems including poison and \n\nparalysis.\n\nPOKéMON will consider using moves in\nthese three categories.</string>
    <string id="270856936">When not under command by its TRAINER,\na POKéMON may be unable to effectively\n\nuse certain moves.\n\nA POKéMON is not good at using any\nmove that it dislikes.\n\nIf a POKéMON only knows moves that\ndo not match its nature, it will often\n\nbe unable to live up to its potential.</string>
    <string id="270857204">Depending on its nature, a POKéMON may\nstart using moves that don't match its\n\nnature when it is in trouble.\n\nIf a POKéMON begins behaving oddly\nin a pinch, watch it carefully.</string>
    <string id="270857693">People and POKéMON, they are but\nthe same...\n\nTheir individual nature makes them\ngood at certain things, and not good\n\nat others.</string>
    <string id="270857819">Rather than trying to make a POKéMON\ndo what it dislikes, try to let it do\n\nwhat it likes and is good at doing.\n\nPut yourself in the POKéMON's position\nand consider what moves it would like.</string>
    <string id="270858008">A POKéMON's nature is a remarkable\nthing...\n\nSome POKéMON behave in a completely\ndifferent way when they are cornered.</string>
    <string id="270858124">Are you beginning to understand how\na POKéMON's nature makes it behave?</string>
    <string id="270858196">Ah... I see a strong, heartfelt bond\nbetween you and your POKéMON...</string>

    <string id="270887705">Shall I record your last BATTLE ARENA\nmatch on your FRONTIER PASS?</string>
    <string id="270887772">I lost on the REFEREE's decision...\n\nI don't think it was a good idea to only\nuse defensive moves and not attack...</string>
    <string id="270887883">I won in judging!\n\nLanding hits consistently on\nthe opponent's POKéMON worked!</string>
    <string id="270887961">Our match was declared a draw.\n\nWhen we ran out of time, both my\nPOKéMON and the opponent's had about\n\nthe same amount of HP left.</string>
    <string id="270888090">In the BATTLE ARENA, the order of\nPOKéMON is totally important.\n\nFor example, if your first POKéMON\nhas certain type disadvantages,\n\ntry making your second POKéMON one\n\nwith moves that are super effective\n\nagainst the first one.\n\nI think that will be a good way of\nmaking an effective team.</string>
    <string id="270888376">The Set KO Tourney's rules are listed.</string>
    <string id="270888415">Which heading do you want to read?</string>
    <string id="270888450">The Set KO Tourney has special rules,\nunlike standard battles.\n\nFirst, one battle lasts only\nthree turns.\n\nIf the outcome is not decided after\nthree turns, it goes to judging.\n\nThe REFEREE will choose the winner\nbased on how the POKéMON battled.\n\nAlso, a POKéMON cannot be switched out\nuntil its battle's outcome is decided.</string>
    <string id="270888771">The first judging factor is «Mind.»\nThis factor evaluates how aggressive\n\nthe battlers were.\n\nThe judging is based on how often\nthe TRAINERS ordered the use of\n\noffensive moves.</string>
    <string id="270888946">The second judging factor is «Skill.»\nThis factor evaluates how effectively\n\nPOKéMON moves were used.\n\nIf a move worked successfully,\nthe Skill rating goes up.\n\nIf a move failed, the Skill rating\nis lowered.\n\nIf it was an offensive move, the Skill\nrating goes up if the move was «super\n\neffective» and goes down if it was\n\n«not very effective.»\n\nThe Skill rating will not go up for\nmoves such as PROTECT and DETECT.\n\nIf the opponent used PROTECT or\nDETECT, and your POKéMON failed to\n\nhit with a move, its Skill rating will not\n\ngo down.</string>
    <string id="270889474">The third judging factor is «Body.»\nThis factor is based on how much HP\n\nremained at the end of a battle.\n\nThe rating takes into account how much\nHP a POKéMON had at the start of\n\nbattle, and what remained at the end.</string>
    <string id="270889689">A victory snatched from the ARENA\nTYCOON, and a seven-TRAINER sweep!\n\nWe congratulate you on your most\nsplendid challenge!</string>

    <string id="270934014">...What's that you want?\n\nCan't you see we're kind of busy here?\nCan't your business wait till later?</string>
    <string id="270934113">...Huh?\nYou look to me like a tough TRAINER.\n\nHeheh...\nListen, I have this proposition.\n\nWe have a little group going here,\nand we play a little game with what\n\ngoes on in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\n\nThe rules are really simple.\n\nFirst, we pick one of the facilities\nin the BATTLE FRONTIER.\n\nThen, we each pick a different TRAINER\nwho's taking that facility's challenge,\n\nand bet with our Battle Points.\n\nThe guy who bet on the TRAINER with\nthe best record takes all the Battle\n\nPoints in the pool.\n\nSounds simple, huh?\nSo, anyway...</string>
    <string id="270936672">I'll see to it that you benefit, too.\nSo how about it?\n\nHow about entering that event for me?</string>
    <string id="270936765">All right, that's perfect.\nSo, uh... How about spotting me some\n\nof your Battle Points?\n\nTrust me, I'll show you my gratitude\nafterward.</string>

    <string id="270939181">Not interested?! You shouldn't be\nso afraid to take a chance!</string>
    <string id="270939243">Oh...</string>
    <string id="270939247">I backed the wrong TRAINER again!\n\nMaybe I should be battling normally\nlike everyone else...</string>
    <string id="270939337">That TRAINER...\n\nHe's good, but he gets rattled too\neasily to survive the BATTLE DOME...</string>
    <string id="270939421">Giggle!\nI know a winner when I see one!</string>
    <string id="270939461">Those TRAINERS...\nWhat are they doing?\n\nThey should be taking challenges.</string>
    <string id="270939560">I wonder if they'll be airing interviews\nwith tough TRAINERS today?</string>
    <string id="270939628">If I opened a restaurant here,\nit'd make money for sure.</string>
    <string id="270939685">Whew...\n\nI need to take a breather after\nsome intense battles...\n\nBut even now, I never take a break\nfrom plotting strategy and combos.</string>
    <string id="270940735">SCOTT: Well, hello and welcome!\nHeheh... Sorry about the cramped space.\n\nAnyway, {01}{05}, let me formally\nwelcome you to the BATTLE FRONTIER.\n\nThis is my dream come true.\nIt took me years and years, but I've\n\nfinally given shape to my dream.</string>
    <string id="270940969">On reflection, it was a terribly long\njourney...\n\nI left home alone on a quest to find\nstrong TRAINERS.\n\nNo one can imagine how much effort\nor time it took to make this real.</string>
    <string id="270941140">But that's all in the past.\nNo point dwelling on that!\n\nAll I want for you is to enjoy battling\nto your heart's content here.\n\n{01}{05}, I want you to have this\nas a memento for all the time our\n\npaths crossed on our journeys.</string>
    <string id="270941360">{01} obtained\n{02} Battle Point(s).</string>
    <string id="270941392">SCOTT: You can check your Battle\nPoints on your FRONTIER PASS.\n\nThe more success you have here at\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER, the more Battle\n\nPoints you will collect.\n\nUse your Battle Points the way you\nsee fit, like trading them for items.</string>
    <string id="270941624">I'm expecting great things from you!</string>
    <string id="270941661">SCOTT: Every TRAINER is an individual.\nThey all lead lives of their own.\n\nBut when they're in a battle,\nit doesn't matter who they are.\n\nThey're all the same!\n\nI love the purity of battle,\nwhere everyone is equal.\n\nThat's why I go everywhere seeking\nTRAINERS who are serious about\n\nbattling, and invite them here.</string>
    <string id="270941970">SCOTT: Have you met any of\nthe FRONTIER BRAINS?\n\nBetter yet, have you obtained any\nsymbols from them?\n\nI handpicked the FRONTIER BRAINS\nas the toughest TRAINERS anywhere.\n\nBut I'm sure that seeing how tough\nyou are will startle even them!</string>
    <string id="270942206">SCOTT: You don't just train for battle,\nright?\n\nI think I remember you working on\na POKéDEX as well.\n\nWell, guess what?\n\nYou may run into wild POKéMON in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER somewhere...\n\nFufufu!</string>
    <string id="270942396">SCOTT: Are you enjoying things in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER?\n\n...Wait a second...\nOh!\n\nYour FRONTIER PASS!\nYou've collected the full set\n\nof silver symbols!\n\nThat's more than impressive!\nYou are tough, just as I suspected!\n\nNormally, I wouldn't do something\nlike this, but this is a special time!\n\nI want you to have this.\nI'm sure you can put it to proper use.</string>
    <string id="270942742">SCOTT: I hope you're enjoying\neverything in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\n\n...Wait a second...\nOh, my disbelieving eyes!\n\nYour FRONTIER PASS!\nYou've gathered up the full set\n\nof gold symbols!\n\nThat's more than stupendous!\nYou're incredible, just as I suspected!\n\n... ... ... ... ... ...\n\n{01}, you've got to accept this!\n\nI think you will be able to\nappreciate the value of my gift!</string>
    <string id="270943091">I must say I have the gift of knowing\na good TRAINER when I see one.\n\nI'm so glad I had the foresight to\nbring you here!</string>
    <string id="270943211">Your BERRY POCKET seems to\nbe stuffed.</string>
    <string id="270943250">SCOTT: Oh, I heard about you!\nHow you ruled the BATTLE TOWER!\n\nYou beat over 50 TRAINERS in a row?\n\nThat's fantastic!\nI want you to have this!</string>
    <string id="270943391">SCOTT: Oh, my! I heard about you!\nHow you overwhelmed the BATTLE TOWER!\n\nYou beat over 100 TRAINERS in a row?\n\nThat's ridiculously spectacular!\nYou've got to have this!</string>
    <string id="270943558">I'll be expecting to hear even greater\nthings about you now!</string>
    <string id="270943619">Oops, well, if you have too much\nstuff, come back for this later.</string>
    <string id="270943794">Ehehe!\nI can tell what POKéMON are thinking!\n\nPlease!\nCan I see your POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="270943871">Boo!\nCheapie!</string>
    <string id="270946030">That's silly! An EGG is asleep!\nI can't talk to it!</string>
    <string id="270946082">How charming!\nThat little lady claims she can\n\nunderstand POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="270946148">I have this feeling that the little girl\nis saying something profound.</string>
    <string id="270946219">I know something!\n\nThat little girl plays at the red house\na lot!</string>
    <string id="270946445">My POKéMON is a {03}.\nDo you know it?\n\nIt's quite cute and rather nice.\n\nThis little one, I could trade with\npride!\n\nWould you like to trade me a {02}\nfor my {03}?</string>
    <string id="270946600">Oh, it's adorable!\nThank you!\n\nI promise I'll be good to it!\n\nOh! I hope you'll be good to\nmy {03}, too!</string>
    <string id="270946701">Oh, I'm sorry!\nI don't intend to trade for anything\n\nbut a {02}.</string>

    <string id="270949487">Those ladies, the way they bad-mouth\neach other, you probably think that\n\nthey don't get along.\n\nBut if that were true, they wouldn't\nstay out here together, would they?</string>
    <string id="270949655">When I was just a wee YOUNGSTER,\nthose ladies were strong and beautiful.\n\nThey were idols among us TRAINERS.\n\nEven now, age hasn't dulled their\nabilities.\n\nIn fact, their POKéMON moves have\ngrown even more polished.\n\nBut...

    <string id="270952642">It is the gigantic tower considered\nto be the BATTLE FRONTIER's symbol.\n\nThere are four kinds of BATTLE ROOMS\nin the tower for SINGLE, DOUBLE, MULTI,\n\nand LINK MULTI BATTLES.</string>
    <string id="270952815">The BATTLE DOME is the large building\nshaped like a huge egg.\n\nEvents named Battle Tourneys are held\nin this facility.\n\nThe Battle Tourneys are offered in\ntwo courses--for SINGLE and DOUBLE\n\nBATTLES.</string>

    <string id="270953931">The EXCHANGE SERVICE CORNER is near\nthe BATTLE TOWER.\n\nThe Battle Points you have earned in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER may be exchanged\n\nfor fabulous prizes there.</string>

    <string id="270954208">What would you like to learn about?</string>
    <string id="270954244">All the challenges at the BATTLE\nFRONTIER's facilities come in\n\ntwo courses--Level 50 and Open Level.</string>
    <string id="270954345">The Level 50 course is open to POKéMON\nup to and including Level 50.\n\nPlease keep in mind, however, that\nno TRAINER you face will have any\n\nPOKéMON below Level 50.\n\nThis course is the entry level for\nbattles at the BATTLE FRONTIER.\n\nTo begin, we hope you will challenge\nthis course.</string>
    <string id="270954624">The Open Level course places no limit\non the levels of POKéMON entering\n\nchallenges.\n\nThe levels of your opponents will\nbe adjusted to match the levels of\n\nyour POKéMON.\n\nHowever, no TRAINER you face will\nhave any POKéMON below Level 60.</string>
    <string id="270954858">Virtually any kind of POKéMON may take\non the challenges at all facilities.\n\nEGGS and certain kinds of POKéMON,\nhowever, are not permitted.\n\nThe numbers of POKéMON required for\nchallenges will depend on the facility.\n\nAt all facilities, however, two or more\nof the same kind of POKéMON are not\n\npermitted.</string>
    <string id="270955160">When entering a challenge at a BATTLE\nFRONTIER facility, POKéMON may not\n\nbe holding the same kind of item.\n\nPlease make sure that all POKéMON\nentering a challenge are holding\n\ndifferent items.</string>
    <string id="270955351">I'm your guide to the FRONTIER PASS.</string>
    <string id="270955388">Which would you like to learn about?</string>
    <string id="270955425">There are seven facilities at\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\n\nTRAINERS who gain recognition for\ntheir abilities may be rewarded with\n\nsymbols from each of the facilities.\n\nTo earn a symbol, TRAINERS may need\nto defeat other TRAINERS in a row,\n\nand may need to win events repeatedly.\n\nIt's certainly not easy to win symbols.\nI wish you the best of luck!</string>
    <string id="270955763">It is possible to record one battle\non your FRONTIER PASS.\n\nYou may record a battle you had with\na friend or friends.\n\nOr you may record a battle conducted\nat the BATTLE FRONTIER excluding\n\nmatches at the BATTLE PIKE or\n\nthe BATTLE PYRAMID.\n\nYou may choose to record your match\nat the end of a battle.</string>

    <string id="270956588">At the BATTLE TOWER, an older girl\ntold me that I have a lot of talent\n\nfor battling!\n\nI like POKéMON CONTESTS more!\n\nBut I'm no good at CONTESTS!\n\nI guess having talent and liking\nsomething aren't the same.</string>
    <string id="270956868">There was someone here using a \nPOKéMON I've never seen before.\n\nI never learned about it at\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL at least.\n\nI wonder where you can catch POKéMON\nlike that.</string>
    <string id="270957035">Okay! Next stop, the BATTLE ARENA!\nI'd better get the right POKéMON from\n\nthe PC Storage System.</string>
    <string id="270957131">Giggle... I'm going to go through every\nchallenge with just this baby!</string>
    <string id="270957200">SKITTY: Mya myaaah!</string>

    <string id="270957455">Dear, what do you think of this?\nWouldn't this make a nice gift?\n\nIt's...PRO...TE...IN?\nIt sounds delicious, doesn't it?</string>
    <string id="270957569">A lot of the BATTLE FRONTIER's\nfacilities don't allow the use of items\n\nduring battles.\n\nThat rule makes things tougher than\nthey already are!</string>

    <string id="271132051">{01} took back {02} from\nthe DAY-CARE LADY.</string>
    <string id="271132091">Oh? But you have just one\nPOKéMON.\n\nCome back another time.</string>
    <string id="271132150">Will you take your POKéMON back?</string>
    <string id="271132183">If you leave me that POKéMON,\nwhat will you battle with?\n\nCome back another time.</string>
    <string id="271132264">Huh?</string>
    <string id="271132269">Huh?\nNow, now.\n\nIf you leave that POKéMON with\nme, you'll be left with just one.\n\nYou will be better off if you catch\nsome more, I dare say.</string>
    <string id="271134190">Oh? Did you want to make some POKéBLOCKS\nwith this old-timer?</string>
    <string id="271134248">Excellent!</string>

    <string id="271134374">Okay, a little explanation, then.\n\nOh, don't worry, it's quite simple.\n\nWhen the BLENDER's arrow comes to\nyour marker, just press the A Button.\n\nThat's all you have to do.\nYou'll see how easy it is when you try.</string>
    <string id="271134583">Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\n\nIf you don't have any BERRIES,\nyou can't make any POKéBLOCKS.</string>
    <string id="271134673">Well, that won't do at all now, will it?\n\nIf you don't mind leftovers, you can\nhave one of my BERRIES.\n\nThat way, we could make some POKéBLOCKS\ntogether using the BERRY BLENDER.</string>
    <string id="271134845">If I had some BERRIES left over,\nI'd gladly give you one...\n\nBut, I don't have any to spare today.\nWe'll have to do this another time.</string>
    <string id="271134977">But your POKéBLOCK CASE is full.\n\nYou should use some POKéBLOCKS before\nyou come see me again.</string>
    <string id="271135063">But you don't have a POKéBLOCK CASE.\n\nYou should get a POKéBLOCK CASE and then\ncome see me.</string>
    <string id="271135146">Let's get blending already!</string>
    <string id="271135174">I wonder what kind of POKéBLOCK I'll get?\nThis is so exciting!</string>
    <string id="271135233">Hi, there! Did you want to blend some\nPOKéBLOCKS with us?</string>
    <string id="271135287">Okay!</string>

    <string id="271135473">Okay!\nLet me explain it to you!\n\nWhen the spinning BLENDER's arrow\nreaches your marker, just press\n\nthe A Button.\n\nThat's all it takes.\nPretty easy, don't you think?</string>
    <string id="271135636">Oh, but wait a second here...\nYou don't have any BERRIES.\n\nYou can't make any POKéBLOCKS without\nBERRIES...\n\nWe'll always be around whenever you\nget hold of some BERRIES to blend.</string>
    <string id="271135806">Oh, but wait a second here...\nYour POKéBLOCK CASE is full.\n\nYou should use some POKéBLOCKS and\nthen come back.</string>
    <string id="271135906">Oh, but wait a second here...\nYou don't have a POKéBLOCK CASE.\n\nYou should get a POKéBLOCK CASE and\nthen come back.</string>

    <string id="271136229">Oh, dear!\n\nThen, I'll explain it to you nicely.\n\nWhen the BLENDER's arrow spins to\nyour marker, press the A Button.\n\nThat's all it takes.\nIsn't it simple?</string>
    <string id="271136381">You don't have any BERRIES,\ndo you?\n\nIf you don't have any BERRIES,\nyou can't make any POKéBLOCKS.\n\nWe'll always be making POKéBLOCKS here,\nso let's make some together when\n\nyou get a BERRY or two.</string>
    <string id="271136568">Your POKéBLOCK CASE is full,\nit looks like.\n\nYou should use some POKéBLOCKS up\nand then come back.</string>
    <string id="271136658">You haven't gotten a POKéBLOCK CASE\nyet, it looks like.\n\nYou need to get a POKéBLOCK CASE before\nyou come back.</string>
    <string id="271136761">Okay! Today's going to be the day that\nI set a new BLENDER speed record!</string>
    <string id="271136834">Oh, dear!\nYou look as if you're good at blending.\n\nWould you like to join us?</string>
    <string id="271136911">I'm going to make delicious POKéBLOCKS\nand make my POKéMON cuter.</string>
    <string id="271136973">POKéBLOCKS will be made with your friends \nfrom BERRIES in the BERRY BLENDER.\n\nIs it okay to save the game before\nlinking with your friends?</string>
    <string id="271137109">Searching for your friends...\n... ... B Button: Cancel</string>

    <string id="271143238">Groan...</string>

    <string id="271143390">Do you like cramped quarters\nlike this?</string>
    <string id="271143430">Did my guitar's wailing draw you in?</string>
    <string id="271143467">My one-man show is ruined...</string>
    <string id="271143494">I was playing my guitar where few\npeople were around, but a lot of fans\n\nhave gathered.\n\nHeh, maybe I should turn pro.</string>

    <string id="271144506">Should I...\nOr shouldn't I?\n\nOkay, sure, I will battle!</string>
    <string id="271144559">I shouldn't have battled...</string>
    <string id="271144585">If you're faced with a decision and\nyou let someone else choose for you,\n\nyou will regret it, however things\n\nturn out.</string>

    <string id="271145404">After I lost to you, I learned a bunch\nof things about POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271145468">I lost again?\nWhy couldn't I win?</string>
    <string id="271145502">I'm fabulously wealthy, but I can't\nseem to win at POKéMON...\n\nIt's so deep, the world of POKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271145598">We must have been fated to meet.\nMay I ask you for a battle?</string>
    <string id="271145659">Oh, my!</string>
    <string id="271145667">«Hello» is the beginning of «good-bye.»\nI hope we meet again.</string>
    <string id="271145729">Hello, we meet again.\n\nWe seem to be drawn together. Let's\nregister each other in our POKéNAVS.</string>
    <string id="271145824">We should commemorate how we seem\nto be drawn to each other.\n\nLet's register each other in our\nPOKéNAVS.</string>

    <string id="271146015">«Hello» is the beginning of «good-bye.»\nI hope we meet again.</string>
    <string id="271146077">I fished up a tough-looking POKéMON!\n\nIt has this magical quality to it!\nIt surely looks tough, yes it does!</string>
    <string id="271146185">What the...</string>
    <string id="271146195">Hey, MAGIKARP, you sure don't live up\nto your name, do you?</string>
    <string id="271146255">There's supposed to be a mystical\nrock around here.\n\nDo you know anything about it?</string>
    <string id="271146338">I was thinking too much about that\nrock, while my POKéMON remained weak...</string>
    <string id="271146411">I can spend hours and hours staring\nat a nice rock without growing bored.</string>
    <string id="271146485">Whew! I was worried that a kid was\ndrowning when I saw you.\n\nYou seem to be okay, so what do you\nsay to a battle?</string>
    <string id="271146598">Glub... Glub...</string>
    <string id="271146610">If you are drowning, the signal is to\nwave one arm toward the beach.</string>
    <string id="271146679">Swimming the deep blue sea...\nIt feels the greatest!</string>
    <string id="271146730">I lost...\nNow I'm feeling blue...</string>
    <string id="271146760">Why is the sea blue?\n\nI learned about that at the MUSEUM in\nSLATEPORT, but I forgot.</string>
    <string id="271146844">My body feels lighter in the water.\nIt's as if I've gotten slimmer!</string>
    <string id="271146912">I'm floating...</string>
    <string id="271146926">Your body weight is reduced to just\none tenth in the water.\n\nThat would make me...\nWhoops! I'm not telling you my weight!</string>
    <string id="271147045">The blue, blue sky...\nThe vast sea...\n\nIt's so peaceful...</string>
    <string id="271147097">I lost while I was lounging!</string>
    <string id="271147126">I want to be told I'm relaxing to be\nwith. Giggle.</string>
    <string id="271147177">I'm convinced that the sea keeps\nsecrets from us.</string>
    <string id="271147227">Yes...\nI am no good at battling...</string>
    <string id="271147258">I'm sure there are many secrets to be\ndiscovered in the world's seas.\n\nI mean to find them all!</string>
    <string id="271147353">Huh? I'm so weak, but you're willing\nto register me in your POKéNAV?</string>
    <string id="271147422">I've told you that I'm weak...\nAre you sure you want to do this?</string>
    <string id="271147485">Yes...\nI didn't think I could win.</string>
    <string id="271147518">I may be weak at battling, but my\ndrive to explore can't be bested.\n\nI will travel the seas all around\nthe world!</string>
    <string id="271147631">I'm exhausted from swimming.\nI'm just not used to it.\n\nI need a battle for a change of pace!</string>
    <string id="271147723">I lost because I battled at sea.</string>
    <string id="271147756">Yeah, for me, the sky is a much better\nmatch than the sea.</string>
    <string id="271147815">Which do you prefer, fishing in the\nsea or a stream?</string>
    <string id="271147868">Like in deep-sea fishing, I lost\nspectacularly!</string>
    <string id="271147916">Fishing is the greatest whether it's\nin the sea or a stream.\n\nYou agree with me, right?</string>
    <string id="271148003">Fishing's great, but so is battling.\nIf you don't mind, can we meet again?</string>
    <string id="271148078">I caught a bunch of POKéMON fishing.\nI'll show you an impressive battle!</string>
    <string id="271148151">I lost again spectacularly!</string>
    <string id="271148179">Win or lose, POKéMON are the greatest!\nYou agree with me, right?</string>
    <string id="271148244">What do people do if they need to go\nto a washroom?\n\nWhat if my ROD hooks a big one while\nI'm in the washroom? I just can't go...</string>
    <string id="271148371">I lost because I'm trying to not go\nto the washroom...</string>
    <string id="271148424">Oh, no! I've got this feeling I'll hook\na big one!</string>
    <string id="271148475">Hahahah! I'm a lousy runner, but in\nthe water you can't catch me!</string>
    <string id="271148541">I give up!</string>
    <string id="271148552">I wouldn't lose in a swim race...</string>
    <string id="271148584">The sea is my backyard. I'm not going\nto take it easy because you're a kid!</string>
    <string id="271148660">Did you take it easy on me by any\nchance?</string>
    <string id="271148702">Drifting along with the waves...\nI love it! Why don't you give it a try?</string>
    <string id="271148773">Yawn...\n\nI must have drifted off to sleep while\nI was drifting in the waves.</string>
    <string id="271148847">Ahaha, I lost...\nI'll take a snooze, I think...</string>
    <string id="271148891">Floating and being rocked by\nthe waves--it's like sleeping in\n\na plush, comfy bed.</string>
    <string id="271148973">The sea is like my backyard.\nLet's battle!</string>
    <string id="271149016">I lost on my home field...\nI'm in shock!</string>
    <string id="271149055">I swim the seas with a heart full of\ndreams...\n\nIt's a song!\nAnyways, I'm swimming some more.</string>
    <string id="271149146">You've shocked me to the bone!\nWell, so you won't forget me...</string>
    <string id="271149207">Swimming in the big, wide sea,\nmy POKéMON has grown stronger!</string>
    <string id="271149269">What a shock!\n\nMy POKéMON has gotten stronger, but\nI stayed weak as a TRAINER!</string>
    <string id="271149347">What you learn in battle makes you\na stronger TRAINER.\n\nThe waves taught me that.</string>
    <string id="271149428">Do you know a little town called\nDEWFORD?</string>
    <string id="271149470">I hate this!</string>
    <string id="271149483">A weird saying is getting really\ntrendy at DEWFORD HALL.</string>
    <string id="271149540">Did you want to battle me?\nSure, I'll go with you!</string>
    <string id="271149591">I wasn't good enough for you.</string>
    <string id="271149621">I think you're going to keep getting\nbetter. I'll go for it, too!</string>
    <string id="271149687">LISA: We challenge you as a sister\nand brother!</string>
    <string id="271149735">LISA: Awesome.\nYou're in a different class of tough.</string>
    <string id="271149788">LISA: Do you have any friends who\nwould go to the beach with you?</string>
    <string id="271149854">LISA: If you want to battle with us,\nbring more POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271149911">RAY: We always battle POKéMON,\nme and my sister.\n\nI always lose, but we can beat you\n2-on-2!</string>
    <string id="271150003">RAY: Wowee, you're at a higher level\nthan us!</string>
    <string id="271150049">RAY: My sister gave me my POKéMON.\nI raised it, and now it's my important\n\npartner!</string>
    <string id="271150132">RAY: If you want to battle us,\ngo bring some more POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="271150191">I'm in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut I'm nowhere near tired!</string>
    <string id="271150253">That exhausted me...</string>
    <string id="271150272">I still have swimming and running left\nto do after this.\n\nAm I going to be okay?</string>
    <string id="271150352">My dream is to swim the world's seven\nseas!</string>
    <string id="271150396">I won't be able to swim the seven seas\nlike this...</string>
    <string id="271150446">Playing with marine POKéMON is one of\nthe pleasures of swimming!</string>
    <string id="271150511">Ahoy, there! Are you going out to\nthe ABANDONED SHIP, too?</string>
    <string id="271150570">I'm sinking!\nGlub... Glub...</string>
    <string id="271150595">Some people even go inside that\nABANDONED SHIP.</string>
    <string id="271150643">My liar of a boyfriend told me that\nI look great in a bikini...</string>
    <string id="271150705">Oh, boo!</string>
    <string id="271150714">Even if it's a lie, I love being told\nI look great...\n\nWe girls are so complex...</string>
    <string id="271150791">I love the sea!\nI forget all my worries when I swim!</string>
    <string id="271150844">When I lose a battle, I get all\nstressed out!</string>
    <string id="271150890">Work off your stress by swimming!\nIt's so healthy!</string>
    <string id="271150941">I love WATER-type POKéMON.\nI love other POKéMON, too!</string>
    <string id="271150995">Waaah! I lost!\nWaaah! Waaah!</string>
    <string id="271151024">Shouting is good for me!\nIt uplifts me!</string>
    <string id="271151064">I love tough TRAINERS, too!\nRegister me in your POKéNAV!</string>
    <string id="271151121">Win or lose, I love battling at sea!</string>
    <string id="271151158">Waaah! I lost again!\nWaaah! Waaah!</string>
    <string id="271151193">If you're faced with a challenge,\ntry shouting at the sea!</string>
    <string id="271151252">I take huge pride in my POKéMON.\nWe'll show you one speedy battle!</string>
    <string id="271151319">That wasn't cute at all.</string>
    <string id="271151344">Since I'm at sea like this, I wouldn't\nmind putting on a pink, frilly swimsuit...</string>
    <string id="271151424">Hiyah! Look at my chiseled abs!\nThis is what you call «cut»!</string>
    <string id="271151485">Aiyah!\nFlubbed out!</string>
    <string id="271151505">Hiyah!\n\nMy sculpted abs have nothing to do\nwith POKéMON battles!</string>
    <string id="271151569">Are you properly protected against\nthe sun?</string>
    <string id="271151613">Ouch, ouch, ouch!</string>
    <string id="271151631">Cheeks are the most prone to burning!</string>
    <string id="271151669">I've laid anchor in ports around\nthe world, but SLATEPORT's the best.</string>
    <string id="271151739">You're the best!</string>
    <string id="271151756">In the best port was the best\nTRAINER...</string>
    <string id="271151795">Urrrrppp...\nBattle? With me?</string>
    <string id="271151822">Urp... Ooooooohhhhhh...\nUrrrrpppp...</string>
    <string id="271151853">I'm usually stronger than this!\nI'm just seasick as a dog!\n\nI'm a SAILOR, but...</string>
    <string id="271151931">I'm thirsty... I could go for a SODA POP\nat the SEASHORE HOUSE...</string>
    <string id="271151993">Groan...</string>
    <string id="271152000">I'm getting famished... My inner tube\nlooks like a giant doughnut...</string>
    <string id="271152065">Will you have another match with me\nwhen I'm not all thirsty?</string>
    <string id="271152127">I'm hungry, but I've got enough pep in\nme for a battle!</string>
    <string id="271152183">I lost...\nIt's because I'm hungry...</string>
    <string id="271152216">When you eat on a beach, everything\nseems to taste a little better.</string>
    <string id="271152284">Doesn't a beach umbrella look like\na giant flower?</string>
    <string id="271152335">Mommy!</string>
    <string id="271152342">If you look at the beach from the sky,\nit looks like a big flower garden!</string>
    <string id="271152416">Me?\nI'm here every day!</string>
    <string id="271152440">I'm not losing to you again!\nThat's why I have my inner tube!</string>
    <string id="271152502">Mommy!</string>
    <string id="271152509">If I have an inner tube, me and my\nPOKéMON's cuteness goes way up!</string>
    <string id="271152576">I can't swim without my inner tube,\nbut I won't lose at POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="271152641">Did I lose because I have an inner\ntube?</string>
    <string id="271152682">My inner tube is a fashion item.\nI can't be seen without it.</string>
    <string id="271152743">Hi, big TRAINER.\nWill you battle with me?</string>
    <string id="271152785">Oh, you're strong.</string>
    <string id="271152804">How did you get to be so strong?</string>
    <string id="271152837">Wahahah! This dude's going to catch\nhimself a big one!</string>
    <string id="271152892">This dude just lost one...</string>
    <string id="271152917">This dude thinks you're a big one.\nNo, you're a big-one-to-be!</string>
    <string id="271152980">PAUL: Well, this is a mood-breaker.\n\nI wish you wouldn't disturb our\nprecious time together.</string>
    <string id="271153072">PAUL: Well, I give up.</string>
    <string id="271153095">PAUL: Well, don't tell anyone that\nwe're here.\n\nThis is just our private world of two!</string>
    <string id="271153181">PAUL: We're totally, deeply in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON battle\n\ntogether.</string>
    <string id="271153266">MEL: We're, like, totally in love.\nOur romance is heating up all of HOENN!</string>
    <string id="271153341">MEL: We lost, and it's my fault!\nPAUL will hate me!</string>
    <string id="271153393">MEL: Um, PAUL, are you angry with me?\nPlease don't be angry.</string>
    <string id="271153454">MEL: We're, like, deeply and truly in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON\n\nbattle together.</string>
    <string id="271153546">Tadaah! See?\nMy inner tube's round!</string>
    <string id="271153582">Oh, oh!\nToo bad!</string>
    <string id="271153599">After I showed you my round inner\ntube, too...</string>
    <string id="271153644">I can't swim, so I'm pretending\nto swim.</string>
    <string id="271153685">I thought so!\nI didn't think we could win.</string>
    <string id="271153728">When I learn how to swim, I think\nmy POKéMON will become tougher.</string>
    <string id="271153794">For a guy as macho as me, this kind\nof POKéMON is the perfect match!</string>
    <string id="271153863">I'm cool even in defeat, hey?</string>
    <string id="271153893">For a guy as macho as me, a port\nis the perfect setting!\n\nI guess I'll head for SLATEPORT.</string>
    <string id="271153983">Whoa! Watch it!\nI guess you're not used to BIKE racing.</string>
    <string id="271154039">Whoa!\nMy brakes failed!</string>
    <string id="271154063">Flat tires and brake problems can\ncause serious injury!\n\nInspect your BIKE for problems!</string>
    <string id="271154151">Yo, you!\nCan you keep up with my speed?</string>
    <string id="271154191">Crash and burn!</string>
    <string id="271154207">Speed alone won't let me win at POKéMON.\nI need to reconsider this...</string>
    <string id="271154275">Don't panic if your BIKE's going fast!</string>
    <string id="271154314">I shouldn't panic during POKéMON\nbattles...</string>
    <string id="271154356">There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.</string>
    <string id="271154430">I'll keep chugging on without stressing.\nGive me a shout if you're up to it.</string>
    <string id="271154507">Aren't you going a little too fast?\nTake it easy and let's battle.</string>
    <string id="271154574">I didn't panic, but I still lost...</string>
    <string id="271154608">There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.</string>
    <string id="271154682">The triathlon is hard in the extreme.\n\nYou have to complete the three events\nof swimming, cycling, and running.</string>
    <string id="271154793">POKéMON battles are hard, too!</string>
    <string id="271154824">I'm exhausted, so I need a break.\nIt's important to get proper rest.</string>
    <string id="271154893">You know, I like you!\nLet's have a rematch on CYCLING ROAD.</string>
    <string id="271154953">Isn't it neat to hold a battle while\ncycling?</string>
    <string id="271154999">Wow...\nHow could you be so strong?</string>
    <string id="271155032">Were you going after a record?\n\nI'm sorry if I held you up!</string>
    <string id="271155091">I've been riding without stopping.\nMy thighs are like rocks!</string>
    <string id="271155152">I'm worried about muscle cramps...</string>
    <string id="271155185">Oh, you have some GYM BADGES?\nNo wonder you're so strong!</string>
    <string id="271155243">I have foreseen your intentions!\nI cannot possibly lose!</string>
    <string id="271155300">I failed to prophesize my own demise!</string>
    <string id="271155338">I see your future...\n\nHmm...\nI see a shining light...</string>
    <string id="271155385">Ahahahaha!\nI'll dazzle you with my wonders!</string>
    <string id="271155429">I wondrously lost!</string>
    <string id="271155448">You managed to win only because it was\na wonder! Yes, a wonder!\n\nDon't think you can win all the time!</string>
    <string id="271155550">Could I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?</string>
    <string id="271155599">I wanted to complete\nmy collection...</string>
    <string id="271155635">When I see a POKéMON that I don't know,\nmy passion as a collector is ignited!</string>
    <string id="271155713">I like collecting MATCH CALL\nregistrations, too...</string>
    <string id="271155762">Hi, have you caught any new POKéMON?\n\nCould I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?</string>
    <string id="271155848">Your POKéMON...\nI envy you.</string>
    <string id="271155874">Oh, I long to make all rare POKéMON\nmine!</string>
    <string id="271155916">Hey!\nDon't sneak up behind me like that!</string>
    <string id="271155957">I lost!\nDrat!</string>
    <string id="271155971">Fishing is all about concentration.\nYou have to focus on the floater.</string>
    <string id="271156041">Ahahaha! I would go anywhere to show\noff my delightful POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271156105">Oh, dear, this won't do.</string>
    <string id="271156130">Rather than battling, perhaps I should\nshow off my POKéMON at the FAN CLUB.</string>
    <string id="271156206">That wasn't close to what I could\ndo to show off my POKéMON.\n\nI'll have you as my captive audience\nas often as possible!</string>
    <string id="271156326">Ahahahaha! I would be happy to show\noff my POKéMON as often as you like!</string>
    <string id="271156399">Oh, dear, this won't do.</string>
    <string id="271156424">I don't think that I could ever stop\nfrom showing off my POKéMON.\n\nBut I like to battle, too!</string>
    <string id="271156517">I found some cool POKéMON in the grass\naround here!</string>
    <string id="271156569">Being cool isn't enough to win...</string>
    <string id="271156601">It's hard to battle with POKéMON you\njust caught.</string>
    <string id="271156651">I fell off CYCLING ROAD...\n\nI'll get over my embarrassment by\nbattling with you!</string>
    <string id="271156729">Oops!\nI ended up losing!</string>
    <string id="271156754">Falling... Losing...\nThis is so humiliating for me!</string>
    <string id="271156802">Okay! Full-throttle time! If you can't\ngroove, you get left behind!</string>
    <string id="271156870">You got into the groove all right...</string>
    <string id="271156905">This isn't going to bring me down!\nLosing has made me a better man!</string>
    <string id="271156973">When cute POKéMON help each other...\nYou won't see a more adorable sight!</string>
    <string id="271157045">Have you no compassion or pity?</string>
    <string id="271157077">Okay, okay, you've done the best you\ncould, my pretties.</string>
    <string id="271157134">Oh, hey! Those GO-GOGGLES suit you.\nBut I think they look better on me.\n\nLet's decide who they look better on\nwith a battle!</string>
    <string id="271157258">I couldn't see what was happening at\nmy sides because of the GO-GOGGLES.</string>
    <string id="271157331">The GO-GOGGLES make it possible to\nget through sandstorms.\n\nThat makes me happy!</string>
    <string id="271157411">I'm having a picnic in the desert.\n\nYou can always find a TRAINER,\nso I can enjoy a battle here, too!</string>
    <string id="271157512">Ohhh! You're mean!</string>
    <string id="271157531">When you're battling in a sandstorm,\nwatch out for your POKéMON's HP.\n\nIt can faint if you don't keep\nan eye on it!</string>
    <string id="271157646">Wearing these GO-GOGGLES makes me\nfeel like a superhero.\n\nRight now, nobody can beat me!</string>
    <string id="271157734">I can't win on spirit alone...</string>
    <string id="271157763">I'm going to be a real hero one day.\nI'm going to work harder to make me\n\nand my POKéMON stronger.</string>
    <string id="271157861">I heard there are fossils to be found\nin the desert. Where could they be?</string>
    <string id="271157935">I came up short...</string>
    <string id="271157952">If they can find fossils in the desert,\nit must have been a sea before.</string>
    <string id="271158024">For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\n\nI am to be challenged?</string>
    <string id="271158099">While I have searched for ruins,\nI've not searched for strong POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271158170">For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\n\nNo, wait, was that forty years?\nWhich was it now?</string>
    <string id="271158272">I haven't been searching for any\ntough POKéMON.\n\nBut, for some reason, I sure do like\nPOKéNAVS.</string>
    <string id="271158367">For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\n\nNo, wait, was that forty years?\nAnyway, am I to be challenged?</string>
    <string id="271158482">I've found no ruins, nor have I found\nany strong POKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271158540">For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\n\nNo, wait, was that forty years\nI've searched?\n\nHmm... It could even be fifty...\nHow long have I been at this?</string>
    <string id="271158697">I'm full of pep!\nAnd my POKéMON is peppy, too!</string>
    <string id="271158744">My POKéMON lost its pep...</string>
    <string id="271158769">When I see a TRAINER with a lot of pep,\nI can't help looking.</string>
    <string id="271158831">I don't know where you're going,\nbut would you like to battle?</string>
    <string id="271158894">Oh, you're disgustingly good!</string>
    <string id="271158924">I'm thinking that I should go to\nMT. CHIMNEY, but the view around\n\nhere is very nice, too.</string>
    <string id="271159014">To train myself, I challenge all\nwhom I meet!</string>
    <string id="271159060">Uncle! I give up!</string>
    <string id="271159078">All I can do is keep training until\nI can defeat strong TRAINERS such\n\nas yourself.</string>
    <string id="271159161">Show me how much you've toughened\nyour POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271159209">I see, you've toughened them\nconsiderably.</string>
    <string id="271159252">POKéMON and TRAINERS learn much\nthrough battling.\n\nWhat's important is to never give up\neven if you lose.</string>
    <string id="271159357">There is much to be learned from\nyour training style.\n\nI request a rematch if it\nbehooves you.</string>
    <string id="271159451">We're training here to elevate our\ngame to the next level.\n\nStay and train with us!</string>
    <string id="271159534">Ooh, you're decent!</string>
    <string id="271159554">Since you're that strong, you should\naim for the POKéMON LEAGUE.</string>
    <string id="271159619">Oh, your POKéMON look like serious\nactors.\n\nI have to ask you for an engagement.</string>
    <string id="271159699">They didn't just look strong,\nthey are strong!</string>
    <string id="271159746">I thought I was raising my POKéMON\ndiligently, but, oh no, there is still\n\nmuch to be done.</string>
    <string id="271159837">I wish I could become friends with\nmore strong people like you!</string>
    <string id="271159901">You can make POKéMON stronger or\nweaker depending on the moves you\n\nteach them.\n\nWhat kinds of moves do your POKéMON\nknow?</string>
    <string id="271160022">You've taught them good moves!</string>
    <string id="271160053">Maybe I should have stopped my\nPOKéMON from evolving until they\n\nlearned better moves...</string>
    <string id="271160139">I shouldn't have come to a place like\nthis for a picnic!</string>
    <string id="271160196">Aww!\nI really shouldn't have come!</string>
    <string id="271160231">In a sandstorm like this, I can't set\nthe places for a picnic even with my\n\nGO-GOGGLES on...</string>
    <string id="271160321">How tough are you?\nWe shall expose that secret!</string>
    <string id="271160369">Oh! Your strength!\nIt is shrouded in mystery!</string>
    <string id="271160415">This desert hoards mysteries in\nits shifting sands!</string>
    <string id="271160467">I'll give you some of my sandwich\nif you'll lose.</string>
    <string id="271160517">Tch! I thought a sandwich would be\nenough of a bribe...</string>
    <string id="271160571">My SANDSHREW loves eating\nmy sandwiches.</string>
    <string id="271160612">This is my favorite kind of POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="271160649">Wait!\nDid you get a good look at my POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="271160694">When having a battle, I get a kick out\nof showing off my POKéMON.\n\nI bet everyone feels that way when\nthey enter a battle!</string>
    <string id="271160816">Show me how to put a little excitement\ninto my life.</string>
    <string id="271160869">Oh... My...\nThat was too much excitement.</string>
    <string id="271160907">My pulse is still racing.\nYou're one fabulous TRAINER.</string>
    <string id="271160962">When you're as famished as I am,\nthere is no room for pity!</string>
    <string id="271161022">Groan...</string>
    <string id="271161029">My stomach is grumbling!\nMaybe I can grill some BERRIES...</string>
    <string id="271161086">Did you come from MAUVILLE?\nThen you should be full of energy!</string>
    <string id="271161149">Ooh lala!\nThat's a lot to take!</string>
    <string id="271161181">This road here...\nYou have quite a ways to travel.</string>
    <string id="271161230">Hahahaha!\nHow about we have a battle?\n\nYou and me!\n\nHahahaha!</string>
    <string id="271161290">I lost!\nHahahaha!</string>
    <string id="271161308">Hahahahaha! Something flew up my nose!\nHahahaha-hatchoo!</string>
    <string id="271161365">My legs are solid from pounding up\nand down the mountains.\n\nThey're not going to buckle easily,\nfriend!</string>
    <string id="271161468">Ouch! My legs cramped up!</string>
    <string id="271161494">Try hiking, and I mean really\npounding, on these mountain trails\n\nwith a heavy pack weighing dozens of\n\npounds.\n\nThat, my friend, will get your body\ninto serious shape.</string>
    <string id="271161660">Ow, my legs have cramped up.\nCan you grab me some bandages from\n\nmy backpack?\n\nNo, that's my POKéNAV!\nOh, fine, I'll register you.</string>
    <string id="271161789">I've been keeping fit by hiking.\nPower, I have in spades!</string>
    <string id="271161847">I got trumped in power?</string>
    <string id="271161871">I hear there are some seriously tough\nTRAINERS on top of MT. CHIMNEY.\n\nI intend to get up there and give them\na challenge!</string>
    <string id="271161993">I'm strong.\nI won't cry if I lose.</string>
    <string id="271162028">Waaaah!</string>
    <string id="271162036">I'm not crying because I miss my mommy!\nSnivel...</string>
    <string id="271162084">When you're out on a picnic, why,\nyou simply have to sing!\n\nCome on, sing with me!</string>
    <string id="271162166">Oh, you're so strong!</string>
    <string id="271162188">It doesn't matter if you're good or bad\nat singing or POKéMON.\n\nIf you have the most fun, you win!</string>
    <string id="271162286">I caught hot POKéMON in FIERY PATH!\nTake a look!</string>
    <string id="271162335">What a bumpy ride that was!</string>
    <string id="271162363">I like the way you battle.\nIt has a certain flair to it.</string>
    <string id="271162420">Oh, aren't you an adorable TRAINER!\nPlease, I need a romantic battle!\n\nI'm somewhat decent!</string>
    <string id="271162511">Oh, how strong you are!\nYou've given me quite a shock!</string>
    <string id="271162566">Are you busy right now?\nI was thinking that maybe we can have\n\na rematch right now...\n\nBut it's all right if you're busy.</string>
    <string id="271162684">Can you guess why it's so cool\naround here?</string>
    <string id="271162728">Peeuuw!\nThat stinks!</string>
    <string id="271162749">The volcanic ash blocks the sun,\nso it doesn't get very warm.\n\nThat's good for me--I can't stand heat!</string>
    <string id="271162851">The volcano's eruption is proof that\nthe earth is alive.</string>
    <string id="271162908">You're some kind of strong!</string>
    <string id="271162936">Ouch! Owww! I can't see!\nI got ashes in my eyelashes!\n\nGet it? Ashes and eyelashes?\n\nOkay, that was bad, sorry...</string>
    <string id="271163046">I use this parasol to ward off this\nfilthy, yucky volcanic ash from\n\nmy dear NUMEL.</string>
    <string id="271163129">Huff, huff...\nI am exhausted...</string>
    <string id="271163157">You're very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!</string>
    <string id="271163209">Here, slide under my parasol.\nLet me register you in my POKéNAV.</string>
    <string id="271163274">Oh, hello, hasn't it been a while?\nMay I invite you to battle?</string>
    <string id="271163337">Oh, how super!</string>
    <string id="271163352">You've remained very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!</string>
    <string id="271163413">From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!</string>
    <string id="271163468">With honor I admit defeat!</string>
    <string id="271163495">I must refine the art of concealment.\nI bid thee farewell.</string>
    <string id="271163554">Yiiyaah! Witness the ancient ninja\ntechnique of POKéNAV registration!</string>
    <string id="271163624">From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!</string>
    <string id="271163679">With honor I admit defeat!</string>
    <string id="271163706">My flawless concealment was let down\nby my immature battle skills...\n\nI bid thee farewell.</string>
    <string id="271163794">Thanks for finding me!\nBut we still have to battle!</string>
    <string id="271163846">I'll use my ninjutsu on you...\n«VOLCANIC ASH SWIRL CLOAK»!\n\n...What?\nIt's already over?</string>
    <string id="271163929">You know what's crummy about hiding?\nIt's lonely if no one comes along.</string>
    <string id="271164001">TORI: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.</string>
    <string id="271164061">TORI: We lost... It's boring, so I'm going\nto get some more ashes.</string>
    <string id="271164126">TORI: How much ash do we have?\nEnough for a WHITE FLUTE, I hope.</string>
    <string id="271164191">TORI: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we didn't, we would lose!</string>
    <string id="271164252">TIA: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.</string>
    <string id="271164311">TIA: We couldn't win... It's boring,\nso I'm getting some more ashes.</string>
    <string id="271164378">TIA: We have a lot of ashes!\nI think enough for a WHITE FLUTE!</string>
    <string id="271164441">TIA: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we don't, we won't win!</string>
    <string id="271164499">Pfft, with these wings I can\nflick you away!</string>
    <string id="271164544">A... What?</string>
    <string id="271164553">I don't know what to say when I get\nbeaten so easily...</string>
    <string id="271164607">The warmth here is making me drowsy.\nBattle with me so I can stay awake.</string>
    <string id="271164680">This is a dream.\nI'm sure of it...</string>
    <string id="271164713">Losing burns me up...\nI'm just going to sleep right here!\n\nZzz!</string>
    <string id="271164774">Were you maybe in the middle\nof gathering volcanic ashes?</string>
    <string id="271164832">Ehehe.\nWe got beaten cleanly.</string>
    <string id="271164862">I ought to hide under the ashes, too.</string>
    <string id="271164900">Y-you want to battle with me?\nEven though I just caught my POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="271164968">Y-you're all happy to win?\nEven though it's only me?</string>
    <string id="271165021">Oh, so now you want to say a word to\nthe loser?\n\nAren't you just the coolest?\nHumph!</string>
    <string id="271165105">Yodelayhihoo!\n\n... ...\n\nYou're supposed to shout\n«yodelayhihoo» since it doesn't\n\necho here!</string>
    <string id="271165191">Yodelayhihoo!</string>
    <string id="271165205">When I was a wee tyke, I believed there\nwas someone copying me and shouting\n\nback, «Yodelayhihoo.»</string>
    <string id="271165303">If you're not prepared, you shouldn't\nbe up in the mountains!</string>
    <string id="271165365">The mountains are unforgiving...</string>
    <string id="271165396">In the winter, mountains turn deadly\nwith blizzards and avalanches.</string>
    <string id="271165464">Camping's fun! You can fish, roast\nmarshmallows, and tell spooky stories!\n\nBut the best of all are the POKéMON\nbattles!</string>
    <string id="271165583">Way too strong!</string>
    <string id="271165599">I think it's great that I can go\ncamping with my POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271165657">I need to exercise after a meal.\nLet's have a match!</string>
    <string id="271165710">Oh, no!</string>
    <string id="271165718">I just had a tasty meal.\nI'm getting drowsy...</string>
    <string id="271165763">Ufufufufufu...\nWant to battle against my POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="271165811">M-My POKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271165825">A big body that's all lumpy and hard,\nenormous horns, and vicious fangs...\n\nUfufufufu...\nI wish I had a POKéMON like that...</string>
    <string id="271165943">Don't forget what you've done to me!\nI'll make it so you can't forget!</string>
    <string id="271166014">Ufufufufufu...\nCome on, battle my POKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271166055">I feel so lucky getting to see your\nPOKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271166100">Ufufufufufu...\n\nWhen I see POKéMON battling, I get all\nshivery and shaky...</string>
    <string id="271166171">If you're lighting a campfire,\nmake sure you have water handy.</string>
    <string id="271166234">Thanks for dousing my fire!</string>
    <string id="271166262">You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\n\nDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.</string>
    <string id="271166374">You set my spirit on fire.\nLet's register each other!</string>
    <string id="271166428">Have you learned to keep water handy\nfor campfires?</string>
    <string id="271166480">I got hosed down before I could\nflare up, I guess.</string>
    <string id="271166531">You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\n\nDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.</string>
    <string id="271166643">If we were fishing, you wouldn't stand\na chance against me.\n\nSo, bring on your POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="271166730">If we were fishing, I would've won...</string>
    <string id="271166766">I think I'll try my luck at landing\na big one at METEOR FALLS.\n\nThere has to be something in there.\nI just know it.</string>
    <string id="271166881">I like to fish. But I also like to\nbattle!\n\nIf anyone challenges me, I'm there,\neven if I'm fishing.</string>
    <string id="271166981">I like to battle, but that doesn't\nmean I'm good at it...</string>
    <string id="271167037">This time I'll do it!\n\nI always think that, so I can't walk\naway from fishing or POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271167126">TYRA: Well, sure.\nI'm in the mood for it.\n\nI'll teach you a little about POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271167207">TYRA: What an amazing battle style!</string>
    <string id="271167243">TYRA: I was teaching my junior IVY\nabout POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271167293">TYRA: Giggle...\nIf you want to battle with us, just one\n\nPOKéMON isn't enough!</string>
    <string id="271167369">IVY: Who taught you about POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="271167404">IVY: What an amazing battle style!</string>
    <string id="271167439">IVY: I started training POKéMON\nbecause TYRA, my student mentor,\n\ntaught me!</string>
    <string id="271167515">IVY: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nI think it must feel lonesome.</string>
    <string id="271167581">I landed a big one!\nA huge one, I tell you!</string>
    <string id="271167625">What was that about?\nDid mine lose in size?</string>
    <string id="271167669">Okay!\nI'll just fish me a bigger one!</string>
    <string id="271167707">Me!\nI'm not just a pretty face!</string>
    <string id="271167739">That wasn't cute in the least!</string>
    <string id="271167770">I don't want a POKéMON that's\njust cute.\n\nI adore cute ones that have a quirk\nor two!</string>
    <string id="271167855">Have you made your POKéMON evolve\nvery much?</string>
    <string id="271167900">Oh, I see.\nThat's good to know.</string>
    <string id="271167932">Some POKéMON change so much when\nthey evolve, it's startling!</string>
    <string id="271167994">Hm...\nYou seem rather capable...\n\nLet me keep you company!</string>
    <string id="271168048">You're much stronger than\nI'd imagined!</string>
    <string id="271168088">There is no such thing as a born genius.\nIt all depends on effort!\n\nThat is what I believe...</string>
    <string id="271168179">Hmm... A loss this thorough has been\na distant memory.\n\nIf you would allow it, I wish for\nanother opportunity to do battle.</string>
    <string id="271168300">Hm... As always, your agility speaks\nfor itself.\n\nCome, keep me company!</string>
    <string id="271168370">As strong as ever!</string>
    <string id="271168389">All it takes is effort!\n\nI lost because I haven't put in enough\neffort!</string>
    <string id="271168460">You!\n\nMy MACHOP!\n\nDemand a battle!</string>
    <string id="271168493">Ouch, ouch, ouch!</string>
    <string id="271168511">My MACHOP crew!\n\nSo long as they seek power, I will\ngrow strong with them!</string>
    <string id="271168585">My strongest skill is busting bricks\nwith my forehead!</string>
    <string id="271168640">Ugwaaaah!\nMy head is busted!</string>
    <string id="271168669">I've been teaching my POKéMON karate.\n\nIt looks like they'll get a lot better\nthan me. I'm excited about that.</string>
    <string id="271168779">You impress me! Give me a rematch\nafter I redo my training!</string>
    <string id="271168839">After you beat me, we trained hard to\nimprove our skills.\n\nCome on, give us a rematch!</string>
    <string id="271168925">Ugwaaah!\nWe lost again!</string>
    <string id="271168949">My POKéMON will grow stronger!\nI'll redouble my training!</string>
    <string id="271169007">This beach is my secret training spot!\nDon't come butting in!</string>
    <string id="271169069">I haven't trained enough!</string>
    <string id="271169095">The sand acts as a cushion to reduce\nimpact and prevent injury.\n\nThis is the perfect place to train.</string>
    <string id="271169195">Okay, fine, you're free to come here.\nIn return, I'd like to battle you again.</string>
    <string id="271169274">Okay, let's get this battle on!</string>
    <string id="271169306">I can battle but my POKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271169335">Even when I lose, I still get some\nenjoyment out of it.\n\nIt must be that I love POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271169423">I have a rare POKéMON!\nWould you like me to show you?</string>
    <string id="271169477">You...\nYou want my POKéMON, don't you?</string>
    <string id="271169514">I have this rare POKéMON.\nIt's enough to keep me satisfied.</string>
    <string id="271169574">I'll battle while I'm running!\nTry to keep up with me!</string>
    <string id="271169629">Gasp, gasp...</string>
    <string id="271169641">I made the mistake of trying to battle\nwhile running!\n\nI should take a run to calm down...</string>
    <string id="271169729">Take that!\nUltra POKéMON ninja attack!</string>
    <string id="271169768">Waaah!\nOur strategy failed!</string>
    <string id="271169796">But my POKéMON were ultra,\nweren't they?</string>
    <string id="271169837">My POKéMON have black belt-level\nstrength!</string>
    <string id="271169880">This is too humiliating!</string>
    <string id="271169905">I rarely meet anyone who's better\nthan me...\n\nI get it now!\nYou're a GYM LEADER, aren't you?</string>
    <string id="271169995">Our eyes met!\nThere's no getting away now!</string>
    <string id="271170038">Gah!\nNot bad!</string>
    <string id="271170052">Oh, well.\nI think I will TELEPORT home.</string>
    <string id="271170092">You've disturbed my meditation...\nYou'll be punished for it.</string>
    <string id="271170151">You've broken my concentration!</string>
    <string id="271170183">I was meditating with my POKéMON.\nBut this place isn't very peaceful...</string>
    <string id="271170253">If the tunnel doesn't go through, then\nI'll just go over the top.</string>
    <string id="271170319">Gasp... Gasp...\nLosing made me tired...</string>
    <string id="271170353">It's no big deal if there's no tunnel.\nTo a HIKER, mountains are roads!</string>
    <string id="271170425">My POKéMON rule!\nCheck them out!</string>
    <string id="271170458">Ouch! A scrape!\nI have to put on a bandage!</string>
    <string id="271170502">Bandages are signs of toughness!\nI've got another one!</string>
    <string id="271170557">My BUG POKéMON are tough!\nLet's battle!</string>
    <string id="271170597">I lost!\nI thought I had you!</string>
    <string id="271170626">BUG POKéMON evolve quickly.\nSo they get strong quickly, too.</string>
    <string id="271170687">Let me teach you how strong my\nadorable POKéMON is!</string>
    <string id="271170739">You're a notch above me...</string>
    <string id="271170764">POKéMON that possess cuteness and\npower, that's ideal, I think.</string>
    <string id="271170828">We learn all sorts of things at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\n\nI want to test things out for real!</string>
    <string id="271170918">I slacked off in school...\nThat's why I lost.</string>
    <string id="271170962">I'll have to redo some courses at\nthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL.\n\nIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.</string>
    <string id="271171055">I learned at the TRAINER'S SCHOOL\nthat a POKéNAV can register TRAINERS.\n\nI don't really get what that means,\nso can I just try it?</string>
    <string id="271171185">I learned at the TRAINER'S SCHOOL\nthat a POKéNAV can register TRAINERS.\n\nI don't really get what that means,\nso can I just try it?</string>
    <string id="271171315">I've been studying seriously at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\n\nI won't lose like I did last time.</string>
    <string id="271171404">Hunh?\nI studied diligently.</string>
    <string id="271171432">I'll have to redo some courses at\nthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL.\n\nIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.</string>
    <string id="271171525">I study at school, and I study on\nthe way home, too!</string>
    <string id="271171578">I'm in shock--I lost?</string>
    <string id="271171600">Awww, I'll never become an elegant\nTRAINER like ROXANNE this way!</string>
    <string id="271171666">Oh, wow! Isn't that a POKéNAV?\nI have one, too! Please register me!</string>
    <string id="271171734">Oh, wow! Isn't that a POKéNAV?\nI have one, too! Please register me!</string>
    <string id="271171802">I studied a whole lot since I saw you.\nYou must see my achievements!</string>
    <string id="271171871">I'm in shock.\nI lost again?</string>
    <string id="271171899">You've beaten ROXANNE?\nI can't beat you, then. Not yet.</string>
    <string id="271171955">Just so you know, I've never once been\nbested by anyone at anything.</string>
    <string id="271172024">Oh, my goodness.\nThis is a new experience for me.</string>
    <string id="271172074">My life of luxury affords me all that\nI could possibly desire.\n\nHowever, when it comes to POKéMON,\nmy wealth has no meaning.</string>
    <string id="271172198">When you lay your eyes on my POKéMON's\ngorgeous fur, their beauty will render\n\nyou helpless!</string>
    <string id="271172290">Oh, baby, say it isn't so!</string>
    <string id="271172317">Oh, no, no, no!\nYou've mussed up my POKéMON's fur!\n\nYou've ruined my hairdo, too!\n\nI'll have to call my stylist now!</string>
    <string id="271172432">We'll rock you hard!</string>
    <string id="271172453">Aiyiyi!\nNo contest at all!</string>
    <string id="271172480">I should try different POKéMON\ntypes, that's what I ought to do.</string>
    <string id="271172545">It's a dead end up here.\nI'm bored, so can we battle?</string>
    <string id="271172599">That was fun even though I lost.</string>
    <string id="271172632">Want to stay here and keep\nme company?</string>
    <string id="271172671">Listen, could I get you to battle\nthe POKéMON I'm raising?</string>
    <string id="271172730">You've raised yours superbly...</string>
    <string id="271172760">POKéMON isn't all about power.\n\nPolishing a unique aspect of one's\ncharacter is another way of enjoying\n\nPOKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271172872">I'm going to redouble my training.\nWould you come look in on us?</string>
    <string id="271172937">The POKéMON I've been raising are\nlooking good, just like before.</string>
    <string id="271173003">You know how to raise them properly.\nYou might have DAY CARE skills...</string>
    <string id="271173072">Your POKéMON are growing good!\nYou should enter them in CONTESTS.</string>
    <string id="271173138">Please, allow me to evaluate if you\nhave raised your POKéMON properly.</string>
    <string id="271173209">Yes, they are growing properly.</string>
    <string id="271173241">Try raising POKéMON with more\nattention to their character traits.</string>
    <string id="271173308">I'm glad I met a superb TRAINER in you.\nI hope to see you again.</string>
    <string id="271173373">Allow me to reevaluate if you have\nraised your POKéMON properly.</string>
    <string id="271173438">They are growing admirably.</string>
    <string id="271173466">POKéMON seem to like different kinds\nof POKéBLOCKS, depending on their nature.</string>
    <string id="271173541">I'm in the middle of a triathlon, but,\nwhatever, let's have a battle!</string>
    <string id="271173611">I ran out of energy!</string>
    <string id="271173632">I may have blown it...\n\nI might have dropped to last during\nthat battle...</string>
    <string id="271173702">POKéMON have to be strong, too?\nI'd like you to train me!</string>
    <string id="271173760">I'm smack in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut I'm comfortably ahead.\n\nLet's make this a quick battle!</string>
    <string id="271173859">I ran out of energy again!</string>
    <string id="271173886">I was tops in swimming and cycling,\nbut I'm not quite that confident with\n\nPOKéMON yet.</string>
    <string id="271173973">I do my triathlon training with POKéMON,\nso I'm pretty confident about my speed.</string>
    <string id="271174054">I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.</string>
    <string id="271174096">Training is meaningful only if you\nkeep it up regularly.\n\nOkay! I'll resume my training!\nTomorrow!</string>
    <string id="271174194">You appear to be training properly...\nIf you'd like, I'll battle you later!</string>
    <string id="271174268">Are you keeping up with your training?\nI sure am!\n\nLet me show you the evidence!</string>
    <string id="271174348">I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.</string>
    <string id="271174390">I'll resume training tomorrow.\nLet's battle again sometime!</string>
    <string id="271174450">Once a BUG CATCHER!\nAnd now a BUG MANIAC!\n\nBut my love for POKéMON remains\nunchanged!</string>
    <string id="271174535">My ineptitude also remains\nunchanged...</string>
    <string id="271174573">All I did was follow my heart, and now\nthey call me a BUG MANIAC...\n\nStill, I am an expert on BUG POKéMON,\nso it's only natural that they call me\n\na BUG MANIAC.</string>
    <string id="271174730">ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner. I have to do good!</string>
    <string id="271174798">ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner! Let me win!</string>
    <string id="271174859">ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\n\nI'd say you're second only to us!</string>
    <string id="271174941">ANNA: We can't take this lying down!\nYou will come back, won't you?</string>
    <string id="271175009">ANNA: If you want to battle us,\nbring two POKéMON with you.</string>
    <string id="271175069">MEG: I'm going to tag up with my super\nsenior student partner and beat you!</string>
    <string id="271175145">MEG: Oh, no!\nI'm sorry, ANNA! I let you down...</string>
    <string id="271175191">MEG: I dragged ANNA down...\nIf I didn't, she would have won!</string>
    <string id="271175250">MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\n\nWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.</string>
    <string id="271175350">ANNA: I can't keep losing in front of\nmy junior partner, right?</string>
    <string id="271175414">ANNA: I couldn't get into the groove.</string>
    <string id="271175452">ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\n\nI'd say you're second only to us!</string>
    <string id="271175534">ANNA: If you want to battle us,\nbring two POKéMON with you.</string>
    <string id="271175594">MEG: I'm going to tag up with my\nsenior partner and win this time!</string>
    <string id="271175661">MEG: Too strong!</string>
    <string id="271175678">MEG: I battled together with my\nsenior partner, but we lost...\n\nThat's so discouraging...</string>
    <string id="271175763">MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\n\nWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.</string>
    <string id="271175863">Isn't it nice? To battle while looking\nat pretty flowers?</string>
    <string id="271175921">Oh, that's quite impressive!</string>
    <string id="271175950">It feels wonderful to go for a jog\nwhile looking at flowers.</string>
    <string id="271176011">Let me demonstrate the power\nhidden within a PSYCHIC POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="271176073">Astonishing!</string>
    <string id="271176086">PSYCHIC POKéMON are complex.\nYou should try catching some.</string>
    <string id="271176145">Concentrate on getting the win.\nThat's how I battle!</string>
    <string id="271176198">I don't waste any time being angry\nover a loss--I would rather train.</string>
    <string id="271176268">I think that if you worry about losing,\nyou're more likely to lose.</string>
    <string id="271176336">The aroma of flowers has a magical\npower. It cleanses us body and soul.</string>
    <string id="271176408">Oh, dear me.\nI seem to have lost.</string>
    <string id="271176442">Flowers, POKéMON...\nI love whatever smells nice.\n\nStinky things...\nI'll pass.</string>
    <string id="271176515">Sniff... That odor--it's a POKéNAV!\nWe must register each other!</string>
    <string id="271176578">Were you drawn here by the sweet\naroma?</string>
    <string id="271176618">The power of aroma...\nIt didn't seem to do much.</string>
    <string id="271176665">If you use a sweet aroma properly,\nPOKéMON will be attracted by it.</string>
    <string id="271176733">BIRD POKéMON that FLY elegantly in\nthe sky... They're the best!</string>
    <string id="271176795">Urgh...\nI crashed...</string>
    <string id="271176812">You've got great POKéMON.\nI'll have to train mine better.</string>
    <string id="271176870">Take flight!\nMy BIRD POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="271176900">They did take flight...</string>
    <string id="271176922">If they'd get stronger, they'd be able\nto fly more freely...</string>
    <string id="271176981">I'm a FISHERMAN, but also a TRAINER.\nI'm raising the POKéMON I caught.</string>
    <string id="271177052">I thought I was doing okay in my\ntraining...</string>
    <string id="271177095">I couldn't win by training POKéMON\nwhile I fished...\n\nWas I doing things in half measures?</string>
    <string id="271177183">For FISHERMEN, equipment is the key.\n\nBut for TRAINERS, the key ingredients\nare POKéMON and heart, of course!</string>
    <string id="271177292">I was beaten in heart?</string>
    <string id="271177315">Come to think of it, fishing is a battle\nbetween a FISHERMAN and a POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271177391">Let my melody rock your soul!</string>
    <string id="271177421">La-lalala...</string>
    <string id="271177432">An electric guitar doesn't always\nhave to be noisy...\n\nIt can be strummed to squeeze out\nthis heart-stirring melody...</string>
    <string id="271177546">When I compose better melodies,\nyou have to come listen, okay?</string>
    <string id="271177609">A melody from my POKéMON and me...\nLet us deliver it to your soul.</string>
    <string id="271177674">La-lalala...</string>
    <string id="271177685">When I play, my emotions should reach\nyou through my electric guitar...</string>
    <string id="271177755">Go, go, go!\nPOKéMON 1, 2, and 3!</string>
    <string id="271177788">Come in, POKéMON! Are you okay?\nPOKéMON 1, 2, and 3?!</string>
    <string id="271177842">Isn't it cool that I have a POKéMON\nbattle team?\n\nYou can copy me--I don't mind!</string>
    <string id="271177922">We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nWe MIMIC what you do!</string>
    <string id="271177968">Whoopsie!\nI lost!</string>
    <string id="271177986">What's so good about mimicry?\n\nFufufu...\nYou'll never understand...</string>
    <string id="271178049">So, we finally meet!\nMy BUG POKéMON will keep you company!</string>
    <string id="271178108">I wish we'd never met...</string>
    <string id="271178131">I want to MIMIC you some more.\nCan you hurry up and move?</string>
    <string id="271178189">If you step forward, we step forward.\n\nIf you turn right, we turn, too...</string>
    <string id="271178260">But if you win, I lose...</string>
    <string id="271178284">I can't MIMIC you winning the match.\nThat's just impossible...\n\nIt's burning me up...</string>
    <string id="271178365">Yep, you've finally caught me!\nOr were you trying to avoid me?</string>
    <string id="271178428">Whoop, that was a great match!</string>
    <string id="271178459">We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nI hope you enjoyed our performance.</string>
    <string id="271178519">You don't know who I am, do you?\n\nBut, I also don't know you.\nSo, we'll battle!</string>
    <string id="271178598">You're pretty strong!</string>
    <string id="271178620">Until you go away somewhere, we'll\nkeep on mimicking your every move.</string>
    <string id="271178690">The MIMIC CIRCLE was formed by people\nwho like to MIMIC.\n\nA battle starts the instant we meet!</string>
    <string id="271178784">I give up!</string>
    <string id="271178795">Won't you join our MIMIC CIRCLE?</string>
    <string id="271178828">Who has the knowledge and\nthe technique for survival?\n\nPOKéMON RANGERS, that's who!</string>
    <string id="271178911">I didn't have enough POKéMON\nknow-how...</string>
    <string id="271178950">To break away from civilization and\nawaken the wild spirit within!\n\nThat's our vision.</string>
    <string id="271179036">I hope you'll give me a rematch without\nmocking my lack of knowledge.</string>
    <string id="271179106">I'm going to regain my wild spirit by\nbeing together with POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271179173">You've remained strong!</string>
    <string id="271179197">Believe in your POKéMON.\nBelieve in yourself.\n\nThe road will reveal itself to you.</string>
    <string id="271179279">Oh? Look at you.\n\nFor someone on an adventure,\nyou're traveling awfully light.</string>
    <string id="271179357">Accidents happen when you're not\nprepared!</string>
    <string id="271179400">You're traveling light but you have\neverything you need.\n\nYou're on top of things mentally and\nphysically, too.</string>
    <string id="271179511">Do you have a POKéNAV?\nIt's a must-have tool for any TRAINER.\n\nOh, you do have one!\nLet's register each other, then!</string>
    <string id="271179627">How's your journey with POKéMON\ngoing?</string>
    <string id="271179666">I'm still missing something...</string>
    <string id="271179695">In the same way that you, as a TRAINER,\nrely on your POKéMON, your POKéMON\n\nrely on you.</string>
    <string id="271179783">The vast sky holds untold promise!\n\nNothing can compare to the sheer\nexhilaration of flight!</string>
    <string id="271179875">Down and out!</string>
    <string id="271179889">My BIRD POKéMON made my dreams of\nflying come true!</string>
    <string id="271179941">I'll show you the true potential of me\nand my BIRD POKéMON!</string>
    <string id="271180001">We lacked potential...</string>
    <string id="271180022">Ever since I was a little kid, I always\nadmired BIRD POKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271180084">To lurk in shadows, and live in\ndarkness... That is my destiny.\n\nI emerge to challenge you!</string>
    <string id="271180173">I admit defeat!</string>
    <string id="271180189">Those defeated in battle withdraw\nquietly back into the shadows.\n\nThat, too, is destiny...</string>
    <string id="271180277">If you're not on your guard,\nyou're in for some pain!</string>
    <string id="271180331">You're surprisingly good!</string>
    <string id="271180357">My surprise attack ended in\nfailure...</string>
    <string id="271180394">To hide a tree, use a forest!</string>
    <string id="271180424">I bow to your superiority.</string>
    <string id="271180451">To hide a tree, use a forest!\nTo hide a POKéMON, use a POKéMON!\n\nThere is no deep, hidden meaning\nto that.</string>
    <string id="271180557">You spoke to me...\nSo you want to challenge me!\n\nSure! I'll try out the POKéMON I caught\nwhile SURFING!</string>
    <string id="271180658">I don't have a clue about what it\ntakes to win.</string>
    <string id="271180706">Go for a SURF on my POKéMON...\n\nThen fish off its back...\n\nIt's an indescribably luxuriant moment!</string>
    <string id="271180799">Hit me with a power chord!\nVictory is mine!\n\nIt's our time to shine, whoa, yeah!</string>
    <string id="271180879">You showed me who's the boss!\nWe'll have to take the loss, oh, no!</string>
    <string id="271180946">Hit me with another power chord!\nLeave me alone!\n\nYour win you have to atone!</string>
    <string id="271181023">Hohoho!\nI like kid TRAINERS!\n\nLet's have a good one!</string>
    <string id="271181075">You're pretty amazing!\nHohoho!</string>
    <string id="271181106">Hohoho!\nI'll try emulating the pep of kid\n\nTRAINERS like you!</string>
    <string id="271181167">Wherever and whenever I may be,\nI always have my parasol in hand.</string>
    <string id="271181233">Oh, but...\nThat's not fair.</string>
    <string id="271181259">You're asking if my parasol is heavy?\nYour BAG is filled with more junk than\n\nI ever carry around.</string>
    <string id="271181357">Do you have any moves that can strike\na flying POKéMON?</string>
    <string id="271181413">You soared above me!</string>
    <string id="271181434">The move FLY is convenient,\ndon't you think?\n\nWhile the POKéMON is flying,\nalmost no moves can strike it.</string>
    <string id="271181539">My POKéMON is strong!\nHow about yours?</string>
    <string id="271181578">Your POKéMON were stronger...</string>
    <string id="271181606">A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.</string>
    <string id="271181661">You can be counted on to get better.\nI'd like to register you in my POKéNAV!</string>
    <string id="271181738">A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.</string>
    <string id="271181793">Your POKéMON are seriously strong.</string>
    <string id="271181828">My POKéMON are growing stronger.\nI have to grow stronger, too.</string>
    <string id="271181891">I'll check your POKéMON and see if\nthey're fit for the outdoors.</string>
    <string id="271181956">With POKéMON that strong, you're in\nno danger of needing rescue!</string>
    <string id="271182021">To travel wherever your heart desires\nwith POKéMON...\n\nThat's the joy of being a TRAINER.</string>
    <string id="271182108">How's your physical fitness?\nIf you're not fit, you could have a\n\nrough time in critical situations.</string>
    <string id="271182208">I'm totally fit, but...</string>
    <string id="271182230">Fitness training is in my routine.\nI always run with my POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271182295">... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\n\nWant to battle?</string>
    <string id="271182335">Lost it...</string>
    <string id="271182344">... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\n\nI'll try harder...</string>
    <string id="271182385">... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\n\nDo you have a POKéNAV...?</string>
    <string id="271182433">... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\n\nWant to battle again?</string>
    <string id="271182479">... ... ... ... ... ...\nI lost again...</string>
    <string id="271182505">... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...\n\nI'll try harder...\n\nFor my precious BUG POKéMON...</string>
    <string id="271182575">POKéMON have many special abilities.\nIf you want to become a first-class\n\nTRAINER, learn about them.</string>
    <string id="271182675">You're obviously thinking.</string>
    <string id="271182702">The special abilities of POKéMON\nwill make battle styles change.</string>
    <string id="271182767">Who might you be?\n\nAre you perhaps searching for ancient\nruins that are rumored to possibly\n\nexist according to legend?</string>
    <string id="271182885">What a disgraceful setback...</string>
    <string id="271182913">That giant rock... I would like to\nbelieve it may indeed contain ancient\n\nruins. But I see no entrance.</string>
    <string id="271183014">Why am I carrying this parasol?\n\nI'll tell you if you can win against me.</string>
    <string id="271183087">A parasol can't ward off POKéMON\nattacks...</string>
    <string id="271183129">I don't think strong sunlight is good\nfor my POKéMON.\n\nSo I shield them with my parasol.</string>
    <string id="271183217">Me, POKéMON, and my parasol...\n\nIf any one of them is missing,\nthe picture of beauty will be ruined.</string>
    <string id="271183315">You've completely ruined my beauty...</string>
    <string id="271183351">A parasol wouldn't suit you at all.\n\nWhy, something like this would only\nget in your way.</string>
    <string id="271183440">I will adopt the movements of POKéMON\nand create new ninja techniques.</string>
    <string id="271183511">The creation of new ninja techniques\nis but a distant dream...</string>
    <string id="271183572">Perhaps I ought to apprentice under\na ninja sensei.</string>
    <string id="271183624">We ninja conceal ourselves under our\ncamouflage cloaks.\n\nI bet you didn't know where I was!</string>
    <string id="271183715">I lost!\nI should camouflage my shame!</string>
    <string id="271183753">Our camouflage cloaks are all\nhandmade.</string>
    <string id="271183793">If you don't pay attention,\nyou could get hurt!</string>
    <string id="271183841">Ouch!\nI was the one to get hurt.</string>
    <string id="271183874">I wonder... Should I evolve my POKéMON?\nThey're cute the way they are, though.</string>
    <string id="271183951">Your party POKéMON...\nDo you have different types?</string>
    <string id="271184000">I've seen your policy in action!</string>
    <string id="271184033">I think it's awesome you're so strong\nbattling with your favorite POKéMON.</string>

    <string id="271197451">No! My line's all tangled!\nThe party's over!</string>
    <string id="271197496">My fishing line's doing a dance!\nThe tangle tango! Hahaha, snarl!</string>
    <string id="271197562">BIRD POKéMON have excellent vision.\nThey spot prey from great heights.</string>

    <string id="271197650">There're lots of diving spots in\nthe sea around here.\n\nYou can spot them easily from the sky\nbecause of their darker color.</string>

    <string id="271198094">Want to go barefoot for a while?\nSo I can try your RUNNING SHOES?</string>

    <string id="271198751">You have to swim, cycle, and then run\na marathon in a triathlon.\n\nIt's a grueling race that consists\nof three events.</string>
    <string id="271198868">A POKéMON battle is grueling, too...</string>
    <string id="271198903">I have to ride a BIKE next, but...\nI'm about to throw in the towel...</string>
    <string id="271198969">Well, I may as well make the best\nof this. I'd like a rematch sometime.</string>
    <string id="271199041">A triathlon is long. But I guess the\nroad to become the POKéMON CHAMPION\n\nis also a long and grueling one.</string>
    <string id="271199147">A POKéMON battle really is harsh\nand unforgiving...</string>
    <string id="271199197">You should give serious thought to\nchallenges on VICTORY ROAD.</string>

    <string id="271199353">Oh!\nHow could this happen?!</string>
    <string id="271199381">After all I've done to get here,\nI won't give up after one setback.</string>
    <string id="271199449">There is no stronger TRAINER than I!</string>
    <string id="271199486">This can't be!</string>
    <string id="271199501">There probably is no stronger TRAINER\nthan you!</string>
    <string id="271199549">I want to visit EVER GRANDE, so I\ncaught myself a POKéMON that knows\n\nthe move WATERFALL to crest the falls.</string>
    <string id="271199657">I'm crestfallen!</string>
    <string id="271199674">Awww, phooey!\n\nMy POKéMON knows WATERFALL, but\nI don't have the SOOTOPOLIS GYM BADGE!</string>
    <string id="271199759">You're looking awfully tough.\nI wonder if I can win?</string>
    <string id="271199812">Ouch!\nI guess it was impossible to win.</string>
    <string id="271199852">There are tough TRAINERS galore\naround EVER GRANDE.\n\nDo you think I may be out\nof my league?</string>
    <string id="271199944">The sunlight seems to be more harsh\nin this area.</string>
    <string id="271199994">I couldn't see very well because of\nthe sun's glare.</string>
    <string id="271200047">I should go back soon.\nI need to reapply my sunscreen.</string>

    <string id="271200185">If I'm all tensed up, I won't be able to\ngive it my all.</string>
    <string id="271200242">I'm in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut, sure, why don't we battle?</string>
    <string id="271200308">I was sure I'd win!</string>
    <string id="271200328">Do you know what's the greatest thing\nabout triathlons?\n\nTesting the limits of your own\nstrength and endurance against\n\nMother Nature!</string>
    <string id="271200461">Say hey, hey!\nLet's get on with it!</string>
    <string id="271200497">Beat, I'm beaten.\nThat's it, done!</string>
    <string id="271200532">There's nothing for a loser.\nTime for me to beat it home.</string>

    <string id="271200637">Oh, my.\nI wanted to relax a little more...</string>
    <string id="271200678">Don't you hate making mistakes when\nyou're in a rush?\n\nThat's why I try to take things\nslowly.</string>
    <string id="271200772">Surfing isn't as easy as it seems,\nisn't that right?</string>
    <string id="271200825">Winning sure isn't easy.</string>
    <string id="271200850">You have your sights on the POKéMON\nLEAGUE? Keep at it!</string>
    <string id="271200906">What a surprise! I didn't expect to\nsee a TRAINER out in the sea.\n\nI think we should battle!</string>
    <string id="271200998">This kid's awfully tough...</string>
    <string id="271201024">Your eyes have that look of someone\nwho's experienced harsh challenges\n\nand won. It suits you well!</string>
    <string id="271201123">In the deep blue sea,\nmy shattered blue heart finds\n\ncomfort among waves.</string>
    <string id="271201196">Like the vast blue sea,\nthe world of POKéMON spans\n\ndepths beyond belief.</string>

    <string id="271201338">Floating on the open sea like this...\nIt's peaceful.</string>
    <string id="271201389">I needed to be a little less peaceful!</string>
    <string id="271201428">Swimming and battling like this...\nI'm one happy guy...</string>
    <string id="271201480">The sea is teeming with POKéMON.\nIt's not easy swimming, I tell you.</string>
    <string id="271201549">POKéMON raised by TRAINERS are\nseriously tough...</string>
    <string id="271201597">Gasp... Gasp...\nI'm wiped out...\n\nThe going's easy. It's the leaving\nthat's the hard part.\n\nWill I have any energy left to make\nthe return trip?</string>
    <string id="271201734">The sea... The sea... The sea...\nThe sea as far as these eyes can see!\n\nI'm sick and tired of the sea!</string>

    <string id="271201837">Bored I am by the sea, but swim I must.\n\nI'm a born swimmer!\nThat's what I am.</string>
    <string id="271201915">Hi, sweetie, wait!\nWe should battle, you and I!</string>
    <string id="271201963">You're tough in spite of the way\nyou look!</string>
    <string id="271202006">Did you see a guy over there who whines\nthat he's bored of the sea?\n\nThat's all talk.\nHe's hopelessly in love with the sea!</string>
    <string id="271202129">Why do men love bathing suits so much?\n\nThey all ogle me!</string>
    <string id="271202186">I'm out of my depth!</string>
    <string id="271202207">Maybe it's not my bathing suit that\nmakes men look. It must be my beauty!</string>
    <string id="271202281">RELI: We'll work together as siblings\nto take you on!</string>

    <string id="271203074">Tch! ...Oh, wait.\nI'm not angry. Honestly!\n\nBut, boy, you're strong!\nHahaha!</string>
    <string id="271203148">I used to catch colds all the time as\na kid, but I became totally fit after\n\nI started swimming.</string>
    <string id="271203244">I crave more power...</string>
    <string id="271203264">TRAINERS travel the fields and\nmountains, so they must be fit, too.</string>
    <string id="271203332">I try not to swim where the currents\nare too strong.</string>
    <string id="271203385">Oh, please, no!</string>
    <string id="271203401">If I get swept away, I'll lose all my\nsense of place...</string>

    <string id="271203501">Waah!\nI sank in defeat!</string>
    <string id="271203525">I never battle when I know I'll win.\nI like to battle at the razor's edge of\n\nvictory and defeat!</string>
    <string id="271203622">I contemplate POKéMON 24 hours a day.\nHow could you possibly beat me?</string>
    <string id="271203692">I lose.\nI will concede defeat.</string>
    <string id="271203723">Urggh...\nYou're a POKéMON fanatic, aren't you?\n\nYou must contemplate POKéMON 24 hours\na day, don't you?</string>
    <string id="271203824">I'm always with my husband,\nbut I can win even without him.</string>
    <string id="271203884">Oh, I guess I wasn't good enough.</string>
    <string id="271203918">That young man over there looks just\nlike my husband when he was young.\n\nHe's making me blush!</string>
    <string id="271204012">Someone's been watching me intently.\nWas it you?</string>
    <string id="271204061">Wow!\nThat's pretty strong, all right!</string>
    <string id="271204099">I can't shake this feeling that\nsomeone's watching me.\n\nI can't concentrate!</string>
    <string id="271204175">Now where could my wife have gone?\nI'm always with her.\n\nI wonder if I can win on my own.</string>
    <string id="271204264">Ah, I see that I couldn't manage\nto win on my own after all.</string>
    <string id="271204325">My wife must be looking for me.\nI'd best go find her right away.</string>
    <string id="271204390">I liked training here by myself.\nIt's awful that all these people came!</string>
    <string id="271204462">Okay! I won't complain about other\npeople being here.</string>
    <string id="271204516">I suppose I can partner up with that\nold man and challenge that other team.</string>
    <string id="271204592">Did the currents carry you here, too?\nThis must have been fated.\n\nLet's battle!</string>
    <string id="271204671">Strong!\nToo much so!</string>
    <string id="271204692">It's just my luck that a tough TRAINER\nlike you would drift here...\n\nI must be cursed...</string>
    <string id="271204776">I've led a life of woe and misery...\nI've been cast away, and this is where\n\nI've drifted...</string>
    <string id="271204864">Another loss...</string>
    <string id="271204878">A life adrift...\nI don't want it anymore!</string>
    <string id="271204918">Welcome!\nI've been expecting you!</string>
    <string id="271204952">No! Please!</string>
    <string id="271204964">A strong child TRAINER...\nThat's so annoying!</string>
    <string id="271205008">I want to win like everyone else, but I\nwon't raise POKéMON like everyone else.</string>
    <string id="271205088">Darn it!\nMy way is still too slack!</string>
    <string id="271205124">It's way more fun to do things the way\nI want than to be like everybody else.\n\nI mean, that's obvious!</string>
    <string id="271205226">I came all the way out here with my\nBIRD POKéMON.</string>
    <string id="271205276">You...\nYou're stunningly cool!</string>
    <string id="271205305">I'd like to go back to FORTREE,\nbut I've grown to like this place, too.</string>
    <string id="271205377">I must have battled thousands\nof times. I've lost count.</string>
    <string id="271205434">I may have lost thousands of times,\nbut a loss still stings.</string>
    <string id="271205495">Keep at this, youngster. So you can\nbecome like my husband and me.</string>
    <string id="271205562">Young people are too happy to go with\nthe flow. They're without direction.</string>
    <string id="271205637">You have a firm sense of purpose.</string>
    <string id="271205671">Don't let others lead you astray.\nDon't lose direction as you grow older.</string>
    <string id="271205745">Even those POKéMON that can swim are\ncarried along by the rapid currents.</string>
    <string id="271205819">Aiyeeeeh!</string>
    <string id="271205829">I think POKéMON enjoy the fast-running\ncurrents around these parts.</string>
    <string id="271205897">My LUVDISC are looking for a fun\nmatch. Will you join us?</string>
    <string id="271205955">Oopsie!</string>

    <string id="271206018">Okeydokey! That's enough rest, gang!\nIt's time for a match!</string>
    <string id="271206078">Tuckered out again...</string>
    <string id="271206098">My BIRD POKéMON get tired quickly after\na long flight...</string>
    <string id="271206153">You're a POKéMON TRAINER.\nNo need for words. We battle now.</string>
    <string id="271206213">... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...</string>
    <string id="271206237">It was I who challenged you, and yet\nI lost. I am deeply shamed...</string>
    <string id="271206302">The savage tide in this area serves to\nmake us stronger than ever.</string>
    <string id="271206369">I willingly concede defeat.</string>
    <string id="271206397">We will return for more training at\nMETEOR FALLS.\n\nIf you'd like, you should go, too.\nIt will definitely toughen you up!</string>
    <string id="271206517">O-our boat!\nThe tide carried it away!</string>
    <string id="271206555">Awawawawah!\nPlease, stop! Please!</string>
    <string id="271206589">If we can't SURF, how are we supposed\nto get home?\n\nActually, I know a fainted POKéMON\ncan still SURF, but it feels wrong.</string>
    <string id="271206711">Can your POKéMON dodge our\nlightning-quick attacks?</string>
    <string id="271206763">I never knew such a technique existed!\nYou've defeated us thoroughly.</string>
    <string id="271206833">I haven't lost my passion for speed.\nI will try harder.</string>
    <string id="271206889">My POKéMON can't be taken down\neasily!</string>

    <string id="271206964">Haha!\nYou won, all right!\n\nI'll work my way back up by taking on\nTRAINERS I happen to meet!</string>
    <string id="271207055">Listen, have you seen another SAILOR\naround here?</string>
    <string id="271207105">Now, that's something!</string>
    <string id="271207128">Our boat drifted out to sea.\n\nMy buddy's a timid fellow, so I'm\nworried about him.</string>

    <string id="271209275">I want to keep going deeper, but I\nforgot to bring a BIKE.\n\nSomething tells me that rare POKéMON\nlive in the outlying areas.</string>
    <string id="271209399">Sometimes, when I toss a POKéBLOCK at \nPOKéMON, it gets ignored.\n\nDo POKéMON have likes and dislikes\nabout what they eat?</string>
    <string id="271209516">Gasp... Gasp...\nI...made it out here...but...\n\nI'm exhausted... I don't have the\nenergy to catch POKéMON...</string>

    <string id="271209790">I put a POKéBLOCK on the POKéBLOCK FEEDER.\nBut it seems to have disappeared.\n\nI guess POKéMON must have eaten it\nwithout me noticing.</string>

    <string id="271210041">I don't have any POKéBLOCKS, but I caught\na good number of POKéMON.\n\nYou can improve your chances of making\na catch by getting closer to them\n\nbefore throwing a SAFARI BALL.</string>
    <string id="271210209">If you use POKéBLOCKS, wild POKéMON won't\nbe so quick to run away.\n\nIt's not much use to give POKéBLOCKS to\nPOKéMON that don't flee easily.</string>
    <string id="271210340">If you put a POKéBLOCK on the FEEDER,\nPOKéMON are attracted to it.\n\nI think POKéMON with the same sort of\nnature are drawn by a certain POKéBLOCK.</string>

    <string id="271216006">If you see BERRIES growing in loamy\nsoil, feel free to take them.\n\nBut make sure you plant a BERRY in the\nsame spot. That's common courtesy.\n\nHere, I'll share this with you.</string>
    <string id="271216178">The way you look, you must be a\nTRAINER, no?\n\nTRAINERS often make POKéMON hold\nBERRIES.\n\nIt's up to you whether to grow BERRIES\nor use them.</string>
    <string id="271216317">I watered the plants every day.\nThey grew lots of flowers.\n\nAnd they gave me lots of BERRIES, too.\n\nHere you go!\nYou can have it!</string>
    <string id="271216445">I'm going to try really hard and make\nBERRIES in different colors.\n\nI hope you try hard, too!</string>

    <string id="271216692">You should try the BERRY CRUSH\nmachine with your friends.</string>
    <string id="271216750">Which BERRY should be planted?\nShould you use or hoard BERRIES?\n\nIt's fun to think about.</string>
    <string id="271216839">BERRIES grow by soaking up sunlight.\n\nWe help the BERRIES grow by watering\nthem regularly.\n\nIt's an expression of love, isn't it?</string>

    <string id="271217379">When it gets right down to it...\n\nIt's because you're a TRAINER!</string>

    <string id="271219352">I'm trying to be like my big sisters.\nI'm growing flowers, too!\n\nHere you go!\nIt's for you!</string>
    <string id="271219443">You can plant a BERRY and grow it big,\nor you can make a POKéMON hold it.\n\nBut now they have a machine that mixes\nup different BERRIES and makes candies\n\nfor POKéMON.\n\nI want some candy, too.</string>
