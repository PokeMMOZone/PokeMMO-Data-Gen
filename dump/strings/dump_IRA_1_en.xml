    <string block_id="0" entry_id="89" table_id="81">There's more to Pokémon than it seems.\n\nThe world of Pokémon battling really gets\ndeeper and deeper.</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="90" table_id="81">I found this when I was cleaning.\nYou can have it if you'd like.\n\n</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="91" table_id="81">Oh, no need to thank me!\nAfter all, I just found it in the trash.\n\nI don't understand it. Recently, many\nfolks have just been throwing away\n\nperfectly good things.</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="92" table_id="81">I may be a Janitor, but I have a lot\nof confidence in my abilities!</string>

    <string block_id="0" entry_id="95" table_id="81">I can't believe a Veteran like me\nwould get into trouble like that.\n\nWhere in the world are the Trainers\nhere training?</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="96" table_id="81">How are you doing, Trainer?\nAre you starting to get tired yet?</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="97" table_id="81">Mumble, mumble, mumble...\n\nIn order to bring good fortune, I always\nthink about my family before a battle.</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="98" table_id="81">I've been watching you battle.\n\nNice technique and judgment... Not\nsurprising, after a win streak like yours.</string>

    <string block_id="0" entry_id="100" table_id="81">Even a Veteran can lose to a Preschooler\nif they get careless.\n\nPokémon battling requires that you\nalways be on guard.</string>

    <string block_id="0" entry_id="54" table_id="469">Haah! It was so relaxing to talk with you!\n\nIt felt great to really let my hair down\nand have some girl talk for a change.\n\nThat's what I think--sometimes you need\nanother girl to talk to, and that's that.\n\nHey, I'm gonna hang out here for a bit!\n\nIf you feel like it, stop by and we'll talk\nsome more!</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="55" table_id="469">Hey! We met the other day!\nGlad to see you! How're you doing?\n\nIf you're not busy, let's hang out again.\n\nWhy don't we have a Pokémon battle\nand chat while riding the Ferris wheel?</string>

    <string block_id="0" entry_id="59" table_id="469">Aww... It's over already! I knew it.\n\nWhen I hang out with you,\ntime just seems to zip by!\n\nI probably shouldn't say this,\nbut I don't have a lot of friends...\n\nSo finding someone to do stuff with and,\nyou know, just talk and stuff...\n\nWell, it's really important to me!\n\nUm, thanks for being someone\nI can talk to.\n\nAnytime you wanna hang out, let me know!</string>
    <string block_id="0" entry_id="60" table_id="469">It's already cold out.\nIt would be so fun if it snowed.\n\nWhat's the matter?\nDo you wanna go for a ride?\n\nOh, I get it.\n\nYou can't ride 'cause\nyou're all by yourself!\n\nThey don't let you ride this\nFerris wheel by yourself.\n\nHey!
